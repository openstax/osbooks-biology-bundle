<para id="fs-id1322516">If you were to remove all the organelles from a cell, would the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm be the only components left? No. Within the cytoplasm, there would still be ions and organic molecules, plus a network of protein fibers that help maintain the cell's shape, secure some organelles in specific positions, allow cytoplasm and vesicles to move within the cell, and enable cells within multicellular organisms to move. Collectively, scientists call this network of protein fibers the <term id="term-00001">cytoskeleton</term>. There are three types of fibers within the cytoskeleton: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules (<link target-id="fig-ch04-05-01"/>). Here, we will examine each.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch04-05-01"><media id="fs-id2076540" alt="Microfilaments line the inside of the plasma membrane, whereas microtubules radiate out from the center of the cell. Intermediate filaments form a network throughout the cell that holds organelles in place.">

<caption>Microfilaments thicken the cortex around the cell's inner edge. Like rubber bands, they resist tension. There are microtubules in the cell's interior where they maintain their shape by resisting compressive forces. There are intermediate filaments throughout the cell that hold organelles in place.</caption></figure><section id="fs-id1228137"><title>Microfilaments</title>
<para id="fs-id1662602">Of the three types of protein fibers in the cytoskeleton, <term id="term-00002">microfilaments</term> are the narrowest. They function in cellular movement, have a diameter of about 7 nm, and are comprised of two globular protein intertwined strands, which we call actin (<link target-id="fig-ch04-05-02"/>). For this reason, we also call microfilaments actin filaments.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch04-05-02"><media id="fs-id1857136" alt="This illustration shows two actin filaments wound together. Each actin filament is composed of many actin subunits connected together to form a chain.">
<image mime-type="image/jpg" src="../../media/Figure_04_05_02.jpg" width="275"/>
</media>
<caption>Two intertwined actin strands comprise microfilaments.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-id1773165">ATP powers actin to assemble its filamentous form, which serves as a track for the movement of a motor protein we call myosin. This enables actin to engage in cellular events requiring motion, such as cell division in eukaryotic cells and cytoplasmic streaming, which is the cell cytoplasm's circular movement in plant cells. Actin and myosin are plentiful in muscle cells. When your actin and myosin filaments slide past each other, your muscles contract.</para>
<para id="fs-id1973921">Microfilaments also provide some rigidity and shape to the cell. They can depolymerize (disassemble) and reform quickly, thus enabling a cell to change its shape and move. White blood cells (your body’s infection-fighting cells) make good use of this ability. They can move to an infection site and phagocytize the pathogen.</para>
<note id="fs-id1685480" class="interactive">
<para id="fs-id1364358">To see an example of a white blood cell in action, watch a short time-lapse video of the cell capturing two bacteria. It engulfs one and then moves on to the other.

<title>Intermediate Filaments</title>
<para id="fs-id1358496">Several strands of fibrous proteins that are wound together comprise intermediate filaments (<link target-id="fig-ch04-05-03"/>). Cytoskeleton elements get their name from the fact that their diameter, 8 to 10 nm, is between those of microfilaments and microtubules.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch04-05-03"><media id="fs-id1743523" alt="This illustration shows 10 intermediate filament fibers bundled together.">
<image mime-type="image/jpg" src="../../media/Figure_04_05_03.jpg" width="350"/>
</media>
<caption>Intermediate filaments consist of several intertwined strands of fibrous proteins.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-id1561464"><term id="term-00003">Intermediate filaments</term> have no role in cell movement. Their function is purely structural. They bear tension, thus maintaining the cell's shape, and anchor the nucleus and other organelles in place. <link target-id="fig-ch04-05-01"/> shows how intermediate filaments create a supportive scaffolding inside the cell.</para>
<para id="fs-id1232860">The intermediate filaments are the most diverse group of cytoskeletal elements. Several fibrous protein types are in the intermediate filaments. You are probably most familiar with keratin, the fibrous protein that strengthens your hair, nails, and the skin's epidermis.</para>
</section>
<section id="fs-id2378542">
<title>Microtubules</title>
<para id="fs-id1430610">As their name implies, microtubules are small hollow tubes. Polymerized dimers of α-tubulin and β-tubulin, two globular proteins, comprise the microtubule's walls (<link target-id="fig-ch04-05-04"/>). With a diameter of about 25 nm, <term id="term-00004">microtubules</term> are cytoskeletons' widest components. They help the cell resist compression, provide a track along which vesicles move through the cell, and pull replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell. Like microfilaments, microtubules can disassemble and reform quickly.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch04-05-04"><media id="fs-id983244" alt="The left part of this figure is a molecular model of 13 polymerized dimers of alpha- and beta-tubulin joined together to form a hollow tube. The right part of this image shows the tubulin structure as a ring of spheres connected together.">
<image mime-type="image/jpg" src="../../media/Figure_04_05_04ab.jpg" width="500"/>
</media>
<caption>Microtubules are hollow. Their walls consist of 13 polymerized dimers of α-tubulin and β-tubulin (right image). The left image shows the tube's molecular structure.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-id1773065">Microtubules are also the structural elements of flagella, cilia, and centrioles (the latter are the centrosome's two perpendicular bodies). In animal cells, the centrosome is the microtubule-organizing center. In eukaryotic cells, flagella and cilia are quite different structurally from their counterparts in prokaryotes, as we discuss below.</para>
<section id="fs-id1454036">
<title>Flagella and Cilia</title>
<para id="fs-id1953693">The <term id="term-00005">flagella</term> (singular = flagellum) are long, hair-like structures that extend from the plasma membrane and enable an entire cell to move (for example, sperm, <emphasis effect="italics">Euglena</emphasis>, and some prokaryotes). When present, the cell has just one flagellum or a few flagella. However, when <term id="term-00006">cilia</term> (singular = cilium) are present, many of them extend along the plasma membrane's entire surface. They are short, hair-like structures that move entire cells (such as paramecia) or substances along the cell's outer surface (for example, the cilia of cells lining the Fallopian tubes that move the ovum toward the uterus, or cilia lining the cells of the respiratory tract that trap particulate matter and move it toward your nostrils.)</para>
<para id="fs-id1886246">Despite their differences in length and number, flagella and cilia share a common structural arrangement of microtubules called a “9 + 2 array.” This is an appropriate name because a single flagellum or cilium is made of a ring of nine microtubule doublets, surrounding a single microtubule doublet in the center (<link target-id="fig-ch04-05-05"/>).</para>
<figure id="fig-ch04-05-05"><media id="fs-id1886153" alt="This transmission electron micrograph shows a cross section of nine microtubule doublets that form a hollow tube. Another microtubule doublet sits in the center of the tube.">
