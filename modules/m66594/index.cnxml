<para id="fs-idp41880912">Order Primates of class Mammalia includes lemurs, tarsiers, monkeys, apes, and humans. Non-human primates live primarily in the tropical or subtropical regions of South America, Africa, and Asia. They range in size from the mouse lemur at 30 grams (1 ounce) to the mountain gorilla at 200 kilograms (441 pounds). The characteristics and evolution of primates are of particular interest to us as they allow us to understand the evolution of our own species.</para>

<title>Characteristics of Primates</title>
<para id="fs-idp129544720">All primate species possess adaptations for climbing trees, as they all descended from tree-dwellers. This arboreal heritage of primates has resulted in hands and feet that are adapted for climbing, or brachiation (swinging through trees using the arms). These adaptations include, but are not limited to: 1) a rotating shoulder joint, 2) a big toe that is widely separated from the other toes (except humans) and thumbs sufficiently separated from fingers to allow for gripping branches, and 3) <term id="term-00001">stereoscopic vision</term>, two overlapping fields of vision from the eyes, which allows for the perception of depth and gauging distance. Other characteristics of primates are brains that are larger than those of most other mammals, claws that have been modified into flattened nails, typically only one offspring per pregnancy, and a trend toward holding the body upright.</para>
<para id="fs-idp93540064">Order Primates is divided into two groups: Strepsirrhini (“turned-nosed”) and Haplorhini (“simple-nosed”) primates. Strepsirrhines, also called the wet-nosed primates, include prosimians like the bush babies and pottos of Africa, the lemurs of Madagascar, and the lorises of Southeast Asia. Haplorhines, or dry-nosed primates, include tarsiers (<link target-id="fig-ch29_07_01a"/>) and simians (New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, apes, and humans). In general, strepsirrhines tend to be nocturnal, have larger olfactory centers in the brain, and exhibit a smaller size and smaller brain than anthropoids. Haplorhines, with a few exceptions, are diurnal, and depend more on their vision. Another interesting difference between the strepsirrhines and haplorhines is that strepsirrhines have the enzymes for making vitamin C, while haplorhines have to get it from their food.</para>

<title>Evolution of Primates</title>
<para id="fs-idm10382048">The first primate-like mammals are referred to as proto-primates. They were roughly similar to squirrels and tree shrews in size and appearance. The existing fossil evidence (mostly from North Africa) is very fragmented. These proto-primates remain largely mysterious creatures until more fossil evidence becomes available. Although genetic evidence suggests that primates diverged from other mammals about 85 MYA, the oldest known primate-like mammals with a relatively robust fossil record date to about 65 MYA. Fossils like the proto-primate <emphasis effect="italics">Plesiadapis</emphasis> (although some researchers do not agree that <emphasis effect="italics">Plesiadapis</emphasis> was a proto-primate) had some features of the teeth and skeleton in common with true primates. They were found in North America and Europe in the Cenozoic and went extinct by the end of the Eocene.</para>
<para id="fs-idp94790960">The first true primates date to about 55 MYA in the Eocene epoch. They were found in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. These early primates resembled present-day prosimians such as lemurs. Evolutionary changes continued in these early primates, with larger brains and eyes, and smaller muzzles being the trend. By the end of the Eocene epoch, many of the early prosimian species went extinct due either to cooler temperatures or competition from the first monkeys.</para>
<para id="fs-idm60205392">Anthropoid monkeys evolved from prosimians during the Eocene epoch. By 40 million years ago, evidence indicates that monkeys were present in the New World (South America) and the Old World (Africa and Asia). New World monkeys are also called Platyrrhini—a reference to their broad noses (<link target-id="fig-ch29_07_01"/>). Old World monkeys are called Catarrhini—a reference to their narrow, downward-pointed noses. There is still quite a bit of uncertainty about the origins of the New World monkeys. At the time the platyrrhines arose, the continents of South American and Africa had drifted apart. Therefore, it is thought that monkeys arose in the Old World and reached the New World either by drifting on log rafts or by crossing land bridges. Due to this reproductive isolation, New World monkeys and Old World monkeys underwent separate adaptive radiations over millions of years. The New World monkeys are all arboreal, whereas Old World monkeys include both arboreal and ground-dwelling species. The arboreal habits of the New World monkeys are reflected in the possession of prehensile or grasping tails by most species. The tails of Old World monkeys are never prehensile and are often reduced, and some species have ischial callosities—thickened patches of skin on their seats.</para>

Apes are generally larger than monkeys and they do not possess a tail. All apes are capable of moving through trees, although many species spend most their time on the ground. When walking quadrupedally, monkeys walk on their palms, while apes support the upper body on their knuckles. Apes are more intelligent than monkeys, and they have larger brains relative to body size. The apes are divided into two groups. The lesser apes comprise the family <term id="term-00002">Hylobatidae</term>, including gibbons and siamangs. The great apes include the genera <term id="term-00003"><emphasis effect="italics">Pan</emphasis></term> (chimpanzees and bonobos) <term id="term-00004"><emphasis effect="italics">Gorilla</emphasis></term> (gorillas), <term id="term-00005"><emphasis effect="italics">Pongo</emphasis></term> (orangutans), and <term id="term-00006"><emphasis effect="italics">Homo</emphasis></term> (humans) (<link target-id="fig-ch29_07_02ab"/>).</para>

Two species of orangutan are native to different islands in Indonesia: Borneo (<emphasis effect="italics">P. pygmaeus</emphasis>) and Sumatra (<emphasis effect="italics">P. abelii</emphasis>). A third orangutan species, <emphasis effect="italics">Pongo tapanuliensis</emphasis>, was reported in 2017 from the Batang Toru forest in Sumatra. Orangutans are arboreal and solitary. Males are much larger than females and have cheek and throat pouches when mature. Gorillas all live in Central Africa. The eastern and western populations are recognized as separate species, <emphasis effect="italics">G. berengei</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">G. gorilla</emphasis>. Gorillas are strongly sexually dimorphic, with males about twice the size of females. In older males, called silverbacks, the hair on the back turns white or gray. Chimpanzees (<link target-id="fig-ch29_07_05ab"/>b) are the species considered to be most closely related to humans. However, the species most closely related to the chimpanzee is the bonobo. Genetic evidence suggests that chimpanzee and human lineages separated 5 to 7 MYA, while chimpanzee (<emphasis effect="italics">Pan troglodytes</emphasis>) and bonobo (<emphasis effect="italics">Pan paniscus</emphasis>) lineages separated about 2 MYA. Chimpanzees and bonobos both live in Central Africa, but the two species are separated by the Congo River, a significant geographic barrier. Bonobos are slighter than chimpanzees, but have longer legs and more hair on their heads. In chimpanzees, white tail tufts identify juveniles, while bonobos keep their white tail tufts for life. Bonobos also have higher-pitched voices than chimpanzees. Chimpanzees are more aggressive and sometimes kill animals from other groups, while bonobos are not known to do so. Both chimpanzees and bonobos are omnivorous. Orangutan and gorilla diets also include foods from multiple sources, although the predominant food items are fruits for orangutans and foliage for gorillas.</para>

<title>Human Evolution</title>
<para id="fs-idp13304272">The family Hominidae of order Primates includes the hominoids: the great apes and humans (<link target-id="fig-ch29_07_03"/>). Evidence from the fossil record and from a comparison of human and chimpanzee DNA suggests that humans and chimpanzees diverged from a common hominoid ancestor approximately six million years ago. Several species evolved from the evolutionary branch that includes humans, although our species is the only surviving member. The term hominin is used to refer to those species that evolved after this split of the primate line, thereby designating species that are more closely related to humans than to chimpanzees. A number of marker features differentiate humans from the other hominoids, including bipedalism or upright posture, increase in the size of the brain, and a fully opposable thumb that can touch the little finger. Bipedal hominins include several groups that were probably part of the modern human lineage—<emphasis effect="italics">Australopithecus</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">Homo habilis</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="italics">Homo erectus</emphasis>—and several non-ancestral groups that can be considered “cousins” of modern humans, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans.</para>
<para id="fs-idp13305673">Determining the true lines of descent in hominins is difficult. In years past, when relatively few hominin fossils had been recovered, some scientists believed that considering them in order, from oldest to youngest, would demonstrate the course of evolution from early hominins to modern humans. In the past several years, however, many new fossils have been found, and it is clear that there was often more than one species alive at any one time and that many of the fossils found (and species named) represent hominin species that died out and are not ancestral to modern humans.</para>

<title>Very Early Hominins</title>

The youngest of the three species, <emphasis effect="italics">Ardipithecus</emphasis>, was discovered in the 1990s, and dates to about 4.4 MYA. Although the bipedality of the early specimens was uncertain, several more specimens of <emphasis effect="italics">Ardipithecus</emphasis> were discovered in the intervening years and demonstrated that the organism was bipedal. Two different species of <emphasis effect="italics">Ardipithecus</emphasis> have been identified, <emphasis effect="italics">A. ramidus</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">A. kadabba</emphasis>, whose specimens are older, dating to 5.6 MYA.

<para id="fs-idp206150990">The oldest of the three, <emphasis effect="italics">Sahelanthropus tchadensis</emphasis>, was discovered in 2001-2002 and has been dated to nearly seven million years ago. There is a single specimen of this genus, a skull that was a surface find in Chad. The fossil, informally called “Toumai,” is a mosaic of primitive and evolved characteristics, and it is unclear how this fossil fits with the picture given by molecular data, namely that the line leading to modern humans and modern chimpanzees apparently bifurcated about six million years ago.

<title>Early Hominins: Genus <emphasis effect="italics">Australopithecus</emphasis></title>
<para id="fs-idp37739504"><emphasis effect="italics">Australopithecus</emphasis> (“southern ape”) is a genus of hominin that evolved in eastern Africa approximately four million years ago and went extinct about two million years ago. This genus is of particular interest to us as it is thought that our genus, genus <emphasis effect="italics">Homo</emphasis>, evolved from a common ancestor shared with <emphasis effect="italics">Australopithecus</emphasis> about two million years ago (after likely passing through some transitional states). <emphasis effect="italics">Australopithecus </emphasis>had a number of characteristics that were more similar to the great apes than to modern humans.

In contrast, modern human males are approximately 15 to 20 percent larger than females.

Because a fetus develops from an egg containing its mother’s mitochondria (which have their own, non-nuclear DNA), mtDNA is passed entirely through the maternal line. Mutations in mtDNA can now be used to estimate the timeline of genetic divergence. The resulting evidence suggests that all modern humans have mtDNA inherited from a common ancestor that lived in Africa about 160,000 years ago. Another approach to the molecular understanding of human evolution is to examine the Y chromosome, which is passed from male parent to male offspring. This evidence suggests that all males today inherited a Y chromosome from a male that lived in Africa about 140,000 years ago.</para>
<para id="fs-idm37518298">The study of mitochondrial DNA led to the identification of another human species or subspecies, the Denisovans. DNA from teeth and finger bones suggested two things. First, the mitochondrial DNA was different from that of both modern humans and Neanderthals. Second, the genomic DNA suggested that the Denisovans shared a common ancestor with the Neanderthals. Genes from both Neanderthals and Denisovans have been identified in modern human populations, indicating that interbreeding among the three groups occurred over part of their range.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-idp206826608">All primate species possess adaptations for climbing trees and probably descended from arboreal ancestors, although not all living species are arboreal. Other characteristics of primates are brains that are larger, relative to body size, than those of other mammals, claws that have been modified into flattened nails, typically only one young per pregnancy, stereoscopic vision, and a trend toward holding the body upright. Primates are divided into two groups: strepsirrhines, which include most prosimians, and haplorhines, which include simians. Monkeys evolved from prosimians during the Oligocene epoch. The simian line includes both platyrrhine and catarrhine branches. Apes evolved from catarrhines in Africa during the Miocene epoch. Apes are divided into the lesser apes and the greater apes. Hominins include those groups that gave rise to our own species, such as <emphasis effect="italics">Australopithecus</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">H</emphasis>.<emphasis effect="italics"> erectus</emphasis>, and those groups that can be considered “cousins” of humans, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans. Fossil evidence shows that hominins at the time of <emphasis effect="italics">Australopithecus </emphasis>were walking upright, the first evidence of bipedal hominins. A number of species, sometimes called archaic <emphasis effect="italics">H</emphasis>.<emphasis effect="italics"> sapiens</emphasis>, evolved from <emphasis effect="italics">H</emphasis>.<emphasis effect="italics"> erectus</emphasis> approximately 500,000 years ago. There is considerable debate about the origins of anatomically modern humans or <emphasis effect="italics">H</emphasis>.<emphasis effect="italics"> sapiens sapiens</emphasis>, and the discussion will continue, as new evidence from fossil finds and genetic analysis emerges.</para>

All people past and present, along with the australopithecines, are hominins. We share the adaptation of being habitually bipedal. The earliest australopithecines very likely did not evolve until 5 million years ago. The primate fossil record for this crucial transitional period leading to australopithecines is still sketchy and somewhat confusing. By about 2.5 million years ago, there were at least two evolutionary lines of hominins descended from early australopithecines.</para>
