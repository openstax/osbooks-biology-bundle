<para id="fs-id1167066020805">As was previously stated, under aerobic conditions cellular respiration can yield 36-38 ATP molecules. If oxygen is not present, ATP is only produced by substrate-level phosphorylation. Without oxygen, organisms must use another electron acceptor. Most organisms will use some form of fermentation to accomplish the regeneration of NAD<sup>+ </sup>to ensure the continuation of glycolysis. In alcohol fermentation, pyruvate from glycolysis is converted to ethyl alcohol; during lactic acid fermentation, pyruvate is reduced to form lactate as an end-product. Without fermentation and anaerobic respiration, we wouldn’t have yogurt or soy sauce. Nor would our muscle cells cramp from the buildup of lactate when we exercise vigorously and oxygen is scarce.</para>

These microorganisms are found in soil and in the digestive tracts of ruminants, such as cows and sheep.

<title>Lactic Acid Fermentation</title>
<para id="fs-id2077122">The fermentation method used by animals and certain bacteria, like those in yogurt, is lactic acid fermentation (<link target-id="fig-ch07_05_02" document=""/>). This type of fermentation is used routinely in mammalian red blood cells and in skeletal muscle that has an insufficient oxygen supply to allow aerobic respiration to continue (that is, in muscles used to the point of fatigue). In muscles, lactic acid accumulation must be removed by the blood circulation and the lactate brought to the liver for further metabolism. The chemical reactions of lactic acid fermentation are the following:</para>

The reaction can proceed in either direction, but the reaction from left to right is inhibited by acidic conditions. Such lactic acid accumulation was once believed to cause muscle stiffness, fatigue, and soreness, although more recent research disputes this hypothesis. Once the lactic acid has been removed from the muscle and circulated to the liver, it can be reconverted into pyruvic acid and further catabolized for energy.</para>

<title>Other Types of Fermentation</title>
<para id="fs-id2317124">Other fermentation methods occur in bacteria. Many prokaryotes are facultatively anaerobic. This means that they can switch between aerobic respiration and fermentation, depending on the availability of oxygen. Certain prokaryotes, like <emphasis effect="italics">Clostridia</emphasis>, are obligate anaerobes. Obligate anaerobes live and grow in the absence of molecular oxygen. Oxygen is a poison to these microorganisms and kills them on exposure. It should be noted that all forms of fermentation, except lactic acid fermentation, produce gas. The production of particular types of gas is used as an indicator of the fermentation of specific carbohydrates, which plays a role in the laboratory identification of the bacteria. Various methods of fermentation are used by assorted organisms to ensure an adequate supply of NAD<sup>+</sup> for the sixth step in glycolysis. Without these pathways, that step would not occur and no ATP would be harvested from the breakdown of glucose.</para>
