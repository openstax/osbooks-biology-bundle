Organisms use various strategies to capture, store, transform, and transfer free energy, including photosynthesis. Photosynthesis allows organisms to access enormous amounts of free energy from the sun and transform it to the chemical energy of sugars. Although all organisms carry out some form of cellular respiration, only certain organisms, called photoautotrophs, can perform photosynthesis. Examples of photoautotrophs include plants, algae, some unicellular eukaryotes, and cyanobacteria. They require the presence of chlorophyll, a specialized pigment that absorbs certain wavelengths of the visible light spectrum to harness free energy from the sun. Photosynthesis is a process where components of water and carbon dioxide are used to assemble carbohydrate molecules and where oxygen waste products are released into the atmosphere. In eukaryotes, the reactions of photosynthesis occur in chloroplasts; in prokaryotes, such as cyanobacteria, the reactions are less localized and occur within membranes and in the cytoplasm. (The structural features of the chloroplast that participate in photosynthesis will be explored in more detail later in The Light-Dependent Reactions of Photosynthesis and Using Light Energy to Make Organic Molecules.) Although photosynthesis and cellular respiration evolved as independent processes—with photosynthesis creating an oxidizing atmosphere early in Earth’s history—today they are interdependent. As we studied in Cellular Respiration, aerobic cellular respiration taps into the oxidizing ability of oxygen to synthesize the organic compounds that are used to power cellular processes.</para><para id="fs-id1167066821576" class="ost-reading-discard">Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and learning objectives outlined in Big Idea 1 and Big Idea 2 of the AP<sup>®</sup> Biology Curriculum Framework, as shown in the table.

</note>


<para id="fs-idp15776">Photosynthesis is essential to all life on earth; both plants and animals depend on it. It is the only biological process that can capture energy that originates in outer space (sunlight) and convert it into chemical compounds (carbohydrates) that every organism uses to power its metabolism. In brief, the energy of sunlight is captured and used to energize electrons, whose energy is then stored in the covalent bonds of sugar molecules. How long lasting and stable are those covalent bonds? The energy extracted today by the burning of coal and petroleum products represents sunlight energy captured and stored by photosynthesis almost 200 million years ago.</para><para id="fs-idm163325392">Plants, algae, and a group of bacteria called cyanobacteria are the only organisms capable of performing photosynthesis (<link target-id="fig-ch08_01_01" document=""/>). Because they use light to manufacture their own food, they are called <term>photoautotrophs</term> (literally, “self-feeders using light”). Other organisms, such as animals, fungi, and most other bacteria, are termed <term>heterotrophs</term> (“other feeders”), because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs. A third very interesting group of bacteria synthesize sugars, not by using sunlight’s energy, but by extracting energy from inorganic chemical compounds; hence, they are referred to as <term>chemoautotrophs</term>.</para>

<caption>Photoautotrophs including (a) plants, (b) algae, and (c) cyanobacteria synthesize their organic compounds via photosynthesis using sunlight as an energy source. Cyanobacteria and planktonic algae can grow over enormous areas in water, at times completely covering the surface. In a (d) deep sea vent, chemoautotrophs, such as these (e) thermophilic bacteria, capture energy from inorganic compounds to produce organic compounds. The ecosystem surrounding the vents has a diverse array of animals, such as tubeworms, crustaceans, and octopi that derive energy from the bacteria.

A lizard sunning itself on a cold day can use the sun’s energy to warm up. Photosynthesis is vital because it evolved as a way to store the energy in solar radiation (the “photo-” part) as energy in the carbon-carbon bonds of carbohydrate molecules (the “-synthesis” part). Those carbohydrates are the energy source that heterotrophs use to power the synthesis of ATP via respiration. Therefore, photosynthesis powers 99 percent of Earth’s ecosystems. When a top predator, such as a wolf, preys on a deer (<link target-id="fig-ch08_01_02" document=""/>), the wolf is at the end of an energy path that went from nuclear reactions on the surface of the sun, to light, to photosynthesis, to vegetation, to deer, and finally to wolf.</para><figure id="fig-ch08_01_02" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch08-s01-lo01"><media id="fs-idm32549792" alt="A photo shows deer running through tall grass beside a forest.">

<title>Main Structures and Summary of Photosynthesis</title>
<para id="fs-idm107168592">Photosynthesis is a multi-step process that requires sunlight, carbon dioxide (which is low in energy), and water as substrates (<link target-id="fig-ch08_01_03" document=""/>). After the process is complete, it releases oxygen and produces glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), simple carbohydrate molecules (which are high in energy) that can subsequently be converted into glucose, sucrose, or any of dozens of other sugar molecules. These sugar molecules contain energy and the energized carbon that all living things need to survive.</para>

<para id="fs-idm83121488">Although the equation looks simple, the many steps that take place during photosynthesis are actually quite complex. Before learning the details of how photoautotrophs turn sunlight into food, it is important to become familiar with the structures involved.</para>
<para id="fs-idm194890448">In plants, photosynthesis generally takes place in leaves, which consist of several layers of cells. The process of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the <term>mesophyll</term>. The gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small, regulated openings called <term>stomata</term> (singular: stoma), which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance. The stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf, which helps to minimize water loss. Each stoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response to osmotic changes.</para><para id="fs-idm56890608">In all autotrophic eukaryotes, photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a <term>chloroplast</term>. For plants, chloroplast-containing cells exist in the mesophyll. Chloroplasts have a double membrane envelope (composed of an outer membrane and an inner membrane). Within the chloroplast are stacked, disc-shaped structures called <term>thylakoids</term>. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll, a <term>pigment</term> (molecule that absorbs light) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material, and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain. The thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the <term>thylakoid lumen</term>. As shown in <link target-id="fig-ch08_01_05" document=""/>, a stack of thylakoids is called a <term>granum</term>, and the liquid-filled space surrounding the granum is called <term>stroma</term> or “bed” (not to be confused with stoma or “mouth,” an opening on the leaf epidermis).</para>

<para id="fs-idm84258528">Photosynthesis takes place in two sequential stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light independent-reactions. In the <term>light-dependent reactions</term>, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy. In the <term>light-independent reactions</term>, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions drives the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. Therefore, although the light-independent reactions do not use light as a reactant, they require the products of the light-dependent reactions to function. In addition, several enzymes of the light-independent reactions are activated by light. The light-dependent reactions utilize certain molecules to temporarily store the energy: These are referred to as energy carriers. The energy carriers that move energy from light-dependent reactions to light-independent reactions can be thought of as “full” because they are rich in energy. After the energy is released, the “empty” energy carriers return to the light-dependent reaction to obtain more energy. <link target-id="fig-ch08_01_06" document=""/> illustrates the components inside the chloroplast where the light-dependent and light-independent reactions take place.</para><figure id="fig-ch08_01_06" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch08-s01-lo02 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch08-s01-lo03 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch08-s01-aplo-2-5"><media id="fs-idm54375680" alt="This illustration shows a chloroplast with an outer membrane, an inner membrane, and stacks of membranes inside the inner membrane called thylakoids.

Energy from ATP and NADPH are used to power the Calvin cycle, which produces G3P from carbon dioxide. ATP is broken down to ADP and Pi, and NADPH is oxidized to NADP+.

All of these products contain sugar—sucrose is a plant product, a disaccharide, a carbohydrate molecule, which is built directly from photosynthesis. Moreover, many items are less obviously derived from plants: For instance, paper goods are generally plant products, and many plastics (abundant as products and packaging) are derived from algae. Virtually every spice and flavoring in the spice aisle was produced by a plant as a leaf, root, bark, flower, fruit, or stem. Ultimately, photosynthesis connects to every meal and every food a person consumes.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-idm202695168">The process of photosynthesis transformed life on Earth. By harnessing energy from the sun, the evolution of photosynthesis allowed living things access to enormous amounts of energy. Because of photosynthesis, living things gained access to sufficient energy that allowed them to build new structures and achieve the biodiversity evident today.</para><para id="fs-idm202694912">Only certain organisms, called photoautotrophs, can perform photosynthesis; they require the presence of chlorophyll, a specialized pigment that absorbs certain portions of the visible spectrum and can capture energy from sunlight. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water to assemble carbohydrate molecules and release oxygen as a waste product into the atmosphere. Eukaryotic autotrophs, such as plants and algae, have organelles called chloroplasts in which photosynthesis takes place, and starch accumulates. In prokaryotes, such as cyanobacteria, the process is less localized and occurs within folded membranes, extensions of the plasma membrane, and in the cytoplasm.</para>
