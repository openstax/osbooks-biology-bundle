<para id="fs-id1167063430140">The neuron is a great example of a structure-function relationship at the cellular level. Information flow along a neuron is usually from dendrite to axon and from neuron to neuron or from neuron to a cell of a target organ. Like other eukaryotic cells, neurons consist of a cell membrane, nucleus, and organelles, including mitochondria. <emphasis>Action potentials</emphasis> propagate impulses along neurons. When an axon is at rest, the membrane is said to be polarized; that is, there is an electrochemical gradient across it, with the inside of the membrane being more negatively charged than the outside. We explored the formation of electrochemical gradients using H<sup>+</sup> when we studied photosynthesis and cellular respiration. The neuron, however, uses Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> to establish a gradient. It is also important to recall that ions cannot diffuse across the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and must use transport proteins; in this case, the transport proteins are voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167066792777" class="ost-reading-discard">At rest, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump, powered by ATP, maintains this gradient, known as resting <emphasis>membrane potential</emphasis>. In response to a stimulus, such as an odorant molecule, membrane potential changes, and an action potential is generated along the membrane as the voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels open sequentially, causing the membrane to depolarize. In <emphasis>depolarization</emphasis>, the inside of the membrane becomes more positive than the outside as Na<sup>+</sup> flows to the inside. Repolarization occurs when K<sup>+</sup> flows across the membrane to the outside. In myelinated neurons, action potentials “jump” between gaps of unmyelinated axons (nodes of Ranvier), a phenomenon called saltatory conduction.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167063788962" class="ost-reading-discard">Transmission of a nerve impulse from one neuron to another or to another type of cell such as a muscle cell occurs across a junction called a synapse. <emphasis>Synaptic vesicles</emphasis> at the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron release chemical messengers called neurotransmitters into the junction; neurotransmitters then bind to receptors embedded in the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron. Neurotransmitters may be either excitatory (such as acetylcholine or epinephrine) or inhibitory (such as serotonin or GABA) as they either increase or decrease the change of an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron. Many drugs, including both pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse, can induce changes in synaptic transmission; for example, tetrahydrocannabinol (more commonly known as THC) in marijuana binds to a naturally occurring neurotransmitter important to short-term memory.</para>

<para id="fs-idm175753248">All functions performed by the nervous system—from a simple motor reflex to more advanced functions like making a memory or a decision—require neurons to communicate with one another. While humans use words and body language to communicate, neurons use electrical and chemical signals. Just like a person in a committee, one neuron usually receives and synthesizes messages from multiple other neurons before “making the decision” to send the message on to other neurons.</para>

<title>Nerve Impulse Transmission within a Neuron</title>
<para id="fs-idm42661904">For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive signals. These signals are possible because each neuron has a charged cellular membrane (a voltage difference between the inside and the outside), and the charge of this membrane can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules released from other neurons and environmental stimuli. To understand how neurons communicate, one must first understand the basis of the baseline or ‘resting’ membrane charge.</para>

<title>Neuronal Charged Membranes</title>
<para id="fs-idm247384272">The lipid bilayer membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable to charged molecules or ions. To enter or exit the neuron, ions must pass through special proteins called ion channels that span the membrane. Ion channels have different configurations: open, closed, and inactive, as illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch35_02_01"/>. Some ion channels need to be activated in order to open and allow ions to pass into or out of the cell. These ion channels are sensitive to the environment and can change their shape accordingly. Ion channels that change their structure in response to voltage changes are called voltage-gated ion channels. Voltage-gated ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell. The difference in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called the <emphasis>membrane potential</emphasis>.</para>

This voltage is called the resting membrane potential; it is caused by differences in the concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell. If the membrane were equally permeable to all ions, each type of ion would flow across the membrane and the system would reach equilibrium. Because ions cannot simply cross the membrane at will, there are different concentrations of several ions inside and outside the cell, as shown in <link target-id="tab-ch35_02_01"/>. The difference in the number of positively charged potassium ions (K<sup>+</sup>) inside and outside the cell dominates the resting membrane potential (<link target-id="fig-ch35_02_02"/>). When the membrane is at rest, K<sup>+</sup> ions accumulate inside the cell due to the activity of the Na/K pump, driving both ions against their concentration gradient. The negative resting membrane potential is created and maintained by increasing the concentration of cations outside the cell (in the extracellular fluid) relative to inside the cell (in the cytoplasm). The negative charge within the cell is created by the cell membrane being more permeable to potassium ion movement than sodium ion movement. In neurons, potassium ions are maintained at high concentrations within the cell while sodium ions are maintained at high concentrations outside of the cell. The cell possesses potassium and sodium leakage channels that allow the two cations to diffuse down their concentration gradient. However, the neurons have far more potassium leakage channels than sodium leakage channels. Therefore, potassium diffuses out of the cell at a much faster rate than sodium leaks in. Because more cations are leaving the cell than are entering, this causes the interior of the cell to be negatively charged relative to the outside of the cell. The actions of the sodium potassium pump help to maintain the resting potential, once established. Recall that  sodium potassium pumps brings two K<sup>+</sup> ions into the cell while removing three Na<sup>+</sup> ions per ATP consumed. As more cations are expelled from the cell than taken in, the inside of the cell remains negatively charged relative to the extracellular fluid. It should be noted that chloride ions (Cl<sup>–</sup>) tend to accumulate outside of the cell because they are repelled by negatively-charged proteins within the cytoplasm.</para><table id="tab-ch35_02_01" summary="This table lists different ions and their extracellular and intracellular concentration in millimeters.

Transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical called a neurotransmitter. Transmission of a signal within a neuron (from dendrite to axon terminal) is carried by a brief reversal of the resting membrane potential called an action potential. When neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron’s dendrites, ion channels open. At excitatory synapses, this opening allows positive ions to enter the neuron and results in depolarization of the membrane—a decrease in the difference in voltage between the inside and outside of the neuron. A stimulus from a sensory cell or another neuron depolarizes the target neuron to  its threshold potential (-55 mV). Na<sup>+</sup> channels in the axon hillock open, allowing positive ions to enter the cell (<link target-id="fig-ch35_02_02"/> and <link target-id="fig-ch35_02_03"/>). Once the sodium channels open, the neuron completely depolarizes to a membrane potential of about +40 mV.  Action potentials are considered an "all-or nothing" event, in that, once the threshold potential is reached, the neuron always completely depolarizes. Once depolarization is complete, the cell must now "reset" its membrane voltage back to the resting potential. To accomplish this, the Na<sup>+</sup> channels close and cannot be opened. This begins the neuron's <emphasis>refractory period</emphasis>, in which it cannot produce another action potential because its sodium channels will not open. At the same time, voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels open, allowing K<sup>+</sup> to leave the cell. As K<sup>+</sup> ions leave the cell, the membrane potential once again becomes negative and repolarizes. The diffusion of K+ out of the cell actually continues for a short period of time past the time of the achievement of the resting potential, and the membrane <emphasis>hyperpolarizes</emphasis>, in that the membrane potential becomes more negative than the cell's normal resting potential. This is the result of the slow closing of the K+ channels. At this point, the sodium channels will return to their resting state, meaning they are ready to open again if the membrane potential again exceeds the threshold potential. Eventually all the K<sup>+</sup> channels close, and the cell returns back to its resting membrane potential.

<title>Myelin and the Propagation of the Action Potential</title>
<para id="fs-idm83399120">For an action potential to communicate information to another neuron, it must travel along the axon and reach the axon terminals where it can initiate neurotransmitter release. The speed of conduction of an action potential along an axon is influenced by both the diameter of the axon and the axon’s resistance to current leak. Myelin acts as an insulator that prevents current from leaving the axon; this increases the speed of action potential conduction. In demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis, action potential conduction slows because current leaks from previously insulated axon areas. The nodes of Ranvier, illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch35_02_05"/> are gaps in the myelin sheath along the axon. These unmyelinated spaces are about one micrometer long and contain voltage gated Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels. Flow of ions through these channels, particularly the Na<sup>+</sup> channels, regenerates the action potential over and over again along the axon.

<title>Synaptic Transmission</title>
<para id="fs-idm38017968">The synapse or “gap” is the place where information is transmitted from one neuron to another. Synapses usually form between axon terminals and dendritic spines, but this is not universally true. There are also axon-to-axon, dendrite-to-dendrite, and axon-to-cell body synapses. The neuron transmitting the signal is called the presynaptic neuron, and the neuron receiving the signal is called the postsynaptic neuron. Note that these designations are relative to a particular synapse—most neurons are both presynaptic and postsynaptic. There are two types of synapses: chemical and electrical.</para>

<caption>Communication at chemical synapses requires release of neurotransmitters. When the presynaptic membrane is depolarized, voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels open and allow Ca<sup>2+</sup> to enter the cell. The calcium entry causes synaptic vesicles to fuse with the membrane and release neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft.

Neurotransmitters can either have excitatory or inhibitory effects on the postsynaptic membrane. For example, when acetylcholine is released at the synapse between a nerve and muscle (called the neuromuscular junction) by a presynaptic neuron, it causes postsynaptic Na<sup>+</sup> channels to open. Na<sup>+</sup> enters the postsynaptic cell and causes the postsynaptic membrane to depolarize. This depolarization is called an <emphasis>excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)</emphasis> and makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential. Release of neurotransmitter at inhibitory synapses causes <emphasis>inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs)</emphasis>, a hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane. For example, when the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is released from a presynaptic neuron, it binds to and opens Cl<sup>-</sup> channels. Cl<sup>-</sup> ions enter the cell and hyperpolarizes the membrane, making the neuron less likely to fire an action potential.</para><para id="fs-idm6698288">Once neurotransmission has occurred, the neurotransmitter must be removed from the synaptic cleft so the postsynaptic membrane can “reset” and be ready to receive another signal. This can be accomplished in three ways: the neurotransmitter can diffuse away from the synaptic cleft, it can be degraded by enzymes in the synaptic cleft, or it can be recycled (sometimes called reuptake) by the presynaptic neuron. Several drugs act at this step of neurotransmission. For example, some drugs that are given to Alzheimer’s patients work by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that degrades acetylcholine. This inhibition of the enzyme essentially increases neurotransmission at synapses that release acetylcholine. Once released, the acetylcholine stays in the cleft and can continually bind and unbind to postsynaptic receptors.</para>

<title>Electrical Synapse</title>
<para id="fs-idm110780000">While electrical synapses are fewer in number than chemical synapses, they are found in all nervous systems and play important and unique roles. The mode of neurotransmission in electrical synapses is quite different from that in chemical synapses. In an electrical synapse, the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes are very close together and are actually physically connected by channel proteins forming gap junctions. Gap junctions allow current to pass directly from one cell to the next. In addition to the ions that carry this current, other molecules, such as ATP, can diffuse through the large gap junction pores.</para>
<para id="fs-idm19383344">There are key differences between chemical and electrical synapses. Because chemical synapses depend on the release of neurotransmitter molecules from synaptic vesicles to pass on their signal, there is an approximately one millisecond delay between when the axon potential reaches the presynaptic terminal and when the neurotransmitter leads to opening of postsynaptic ion channels. Additionally, this signaling is unidirectional. Signaling in electrical synapses, in contrast, is virtually instantaneous (which is important for synapses involved in key reflexes), and some electrical synapses are bidirectional. Electrical synapses are also more reliable as they are less likely to be blocked, and they are important for synchronizing the electrical activity of a group of neurons. For example, electrical synapses in the thalamus are thought to regulate slow-wave sleep, and disruption of these synapses can cause seizures.</para>

This process is called <emphasis>summation</emphasis> and occurs at the axon hillock, as illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch35_02_08"/>. Additionally, one neuron often has inputs from many presynaptic neurons—some excitatory and some inhibitory—so IPSPs can cancel out EPSPs and vice versa. It is the net change in postsynaptic membrane voltage that determines whether the postsynaptic cell has reached its threshold of excitation needed to fire an action potential. Together, synaptic summation and the threshold for excitation act as a filter so that random “noise” in the system is not transmitted as important information.</para>

Initially, the membrane potential at the axon hillock is -70 millivolts. A series of EPSPs and IPSPs cause the potential to rise and fall. Eventually, the potential increases to the threshold of excitation. At this point the nerve fires, resulting in a sharp increase in membrane potential, followed by a rapid decrease. The hillock becomes hyperpolarizes such that the membrane potential is lower than the resting potential. The hillock then gradually returns to the resting potential.">

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also called Lou Gehrig’s Disease) is a neurological disease characterized by the degeneration of the motor neurons that control voluntary movements. The disease begins with muscle weakening and lack of coordination and eventually destroys the neurons that control speech, breathing, and swallowing; in the end, the disease can lead to paralysis. At that point, patients require assistance from machines to be able to breathe and to communicate. Several special technologies have been developed to allow “locked-in” patients to communicate with the rest of the world. One technology, for example, allows patients to type out sentences by twitching their cheek. These sentences can then be read aloud by a computer.</para>
<para id="fs-idm8955264">A relatively new line of research for helping paralyzed patients, including those with ALS, to communicate and retain a degree of self-sufficiency is called brain-computer interface (BCI) technology and is illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch35_02_09"/>. This technology sounds like something out of science fiction: it allows paralyzed patients to control a computer using only their thoughts. There are several forms of BCI. Some forms use EEG recordings from electrodes taped onto the skull. These recordings contain information from large populations of neurons that can be decoded by a computer. Other forms of BCI require the implantation of an array of electrodes smaller than a postage stamp in the arm and hand area of the motor cortex. This form of BCI, while more invasive, is very powerful as each electrode can record actual action potentials from one or more neurons. These signals are then sent to a computer, which has been trained to decode the signal and feed it to a tool—such as a cursor on a computer screen. This means that a patient with ALS can use e-mail, read the Internet, and communicate with others by thinking of moving his or her hand or arm (even though the paralyzed patient cannot make that bodily movement). Recent advances have allowed a paralyzed locked-in patient who suffered a stroke 15 years ago to control a robotic arm and even to feed herself coffee using BCI technology.</para>
<para id="fs-idm206604448">Despite the amazing advancements in BCI technology, it also has limitations. The technology can require many hours of training and long periods of intense concentration for the patient; it can also require brain surgery to implant the devices.</para>

<title>Synaptic Plasticity</title>
<para id="fs-idm114094032">Synapses are not static structures. They can be weakened or strengthened. They can be broken, and new synapses can be made. Synaptic plasticity allows for these changes, which are all needed for a functioning nervous system. In fact, synaptic plasticity is the basis of learning and memory. Two processes in particular, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are important forms of synaptic plasticity that occur in synapses in the hippocampus, a brain region that is involved in storing memories.</para>
<section id="fs-idm255135008" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch26-s02-lo04 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch26-s02-aplo-3-43 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch26-s02-aplo-3-45">
<title>Long-term Potentiation (LTP)</title>
<para id="fs-idm118440240"><emphasis>Long-term potentiation (LTP)</emphasis> is a persistent strengthening of a synaptic connection. LTP is based on the Hebbian principle: cells that fire together wire together. There are various mechanisms, none fully understood, behind the synaptic strengthening seen with LTP. One known mechanism involves a type of postsynaptic glutamate receptor, called NMDA (N-Methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, shown in <link target-id="fig-ch35_02_10"/>. These receptors are normally blocked by magnesium ions; however, when the postsynaptic neuron is depolarized by multiple presynaptic inputs in quick succession (either from one neuron or multiple neurons), the magnesium ions are forced out allowing Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to pass into the postsynaptic cell. Next, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that causes a different type of glutamate receptor, called AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors, to be inserted into the postsynaptic membrane, since activated AMPA receptors allow positive ions to enter the cell. So, the next time glutamate is released from the presynaptic membrane, it will have a larger excitatory effect (EPSP) on the postsynaptic cell because the binding of glutamate to these AMPA receptors will allow more positive ions into the cell. The insertion of additional AMPA receptors strengthens the synapse and means that the postsynaptic neuron is more likely to fire in response to presynaptic neurotransmitter release.</para></section>

<title>Long-term Depression (LTD)</title>
<para id="fs-idm193185040"><emphasis>Long-term depression (LTD)</emphasis> is essentially the reverse of LTP: it is a long-term weakening of a synaptic connection. One mechanism known to cause LTD also involves AMPA receptors. In this situation, calcium that enters through NMDA receptors initiates a different signaling cascade, which results in the removal of AMPA receptors from the postsynaptic membrane, as illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch35_02_10"/>. The decrease in AMPA receptors in the membrane makes the postsynaptic neuron less responsive to glutamate released from the presynaptic neuron. While it may seem counterintuitive, LTD may be just as important for learning and memory as LTP. The weakening and pruning of unused synapses allows for unimportant connections to be lost and makes the synapses that have undergone LTP that much stronger by comparison.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch35_02_10" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch26-s02-lo04 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch26-s02-aplo-3-45"><media id="fs-idm209149696" alt="Illustration shows the mechanism of LTP and LTD. Normally, the NMDA receptor in the postsynaptic neuron is activated by glutamate binding, but only after depolarization removes an inhibitory magnesium ion. Once the magnesium is removed, calcium can enter the cell. In response to an increase in intracellular calcium, AMPA receptors are inserted into the plasma membrane, which amplifies the signal resulting in LTP. LDP occurs when low-frequency stimulation results in the activation of a different calcium-signaling cascade that causes AMPA receptors to be removed from the plasma membrane. As a result, the nerve cell becomes less responsive to glutamate.">

</media>
<caption>Calcium entry through postsynaptic NMDA receptors can initiate two different forms of synaptic plasticity: long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). LTP arises when a single synapse is repeatedly stimulated. This stimulation causes a calcium- and CaMKII-dependent cellular cascade, which results in the insertion of more AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. The next time glutamate is released from the presynaptic cell, it will bind to both NMDA and the newly inserted AMPA receptors, thus depolarizing the membrane more efficiently. LTD occurs when few glutamate molecules bind to NMDA receptors at a synapse (due to a low firing rate of the presynaptic neuron). The calcium that does flow through NMDA receptors initiates a different calcineurin and protein phosphatase 1-dependent cascade, which results in the endocytosis of AMPA receptors. This makes the postsynaptic neuron less responsive to glutamate released from the presynaptic neuron.</caption></figure>

In a chemical synapse, the action potential causes release of neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft. Through binding to postsynaptic receptors, the neurotransmitter can cause excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials by depolarizing or hyperpolarizing, respectively, the postsynaptic membrane. In electrical synapses, the action potential is directly communicated to the postsynaptic cell through gap junctions—large channel proteins that connect the pre-and postsynaptic membranes.

<solution id="fs-idm166577312"><label/>
<para id="fs-idm6612944">An action potential travels along an axon until it depolarizes the membrane at an axon terminal. Depolarization of the membrane causes voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to open and Ca<sup>2+</sup> to enter the cell. The intracellular calcium influx causes synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitter to fuse with the presynaptic membrane. The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. Depending on the specific neurotransmitter and postsynaptic receptor, this action can cause positive (excitatory postsynaptic potential) or negative (inhibitory postsynaptic potential) ions to enter the cell.</para>
