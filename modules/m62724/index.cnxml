<para id="fs-id1167062368613">Living organisms need food to survive as it contains critical nutrients in the form of biological macromolecules. These large molecules are composed mainly of six elementssulfur, phosphorus, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen (SPONCH)in different quantities and arrangements. Complex polymers are built from combinations of smaller monomers by dehydration synthesis, a chemical reaction in which a molecule of water is removed between two linking monomers. (Think of a train: each boxcar, including the caboose, represents a monomer, and the entire train is a polymer.) During digestion, polymers can be broken down by hydrolysis, or the addition of water. Both dehydration and hydrolysis reactions in cells are catalyzed by specific enzymes. Dehydration reactions typically require an investment of energy for new bond formation, whereas hydrolysis reactions typically release energy that can be used to power cellular processes. The four categories of macromolecules are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.  Evidence supports scientists claim that the organic precursors of these biological molecules were present on primitive Earth.</para>

<title>Dehydration Synthesis</title>
<para id="fs-id1724224">As you’ve learned, <term id="term-00001">biological macromolecules</term> are large molecules, necessary for life, that are built from smaller organic molecules. There are four major classes of biological macromolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids); each is an important cell component and performs a wide array of functions. Combined, these molecules make up the majority of a cell’s dry mass (recall that water makes up the majority of its complete mass). Biological macromolecules are organic, meaning they contain carbon. In addition, they may contain hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and additional minor elements.</para>

<para id="fs-id1384510">Most macromolecules are made from single subunits, or building blocks, called <term id="term-00002">monomers</term>. The monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as <term id="term-00003">polymers</term>. In doing so, monomers release water molecules as byproducts. This type of reaction is known as <term id="term-00004">dehydration synthesis</term>, which means “to put together while losing water.”</para>

They can attempt to explain how these complex macromolecules could be created in the absence of life. The resulting molecules floated around in the atmosphere and eventually fell into the early oceans, then probably became incorporated into primitive cells.</para>

<para id="fs-id1730720">In a dehydration synthesis reaction (<link target-id="fs-id1167065892188"/>), the hydrogen of one monomer combines with the hydroxyl group of another monomer, releasing a molecule of water. At the same time, the monomers share electrons and form covalent bonds. As additional monomers join, this chain of repeating monomers forms a polymer. Different types of monomers can combine in many configurations, giving rise to a diverse group of macromolecules. Even one kind of monomer can combine in a variety of ways to form several different polymers: for example, glucose monomers are the constituents of starch, glycogen, and cellulose.</para></section>

<title>Hydrolysis</title>
<para id="fs-id1431430">Polymers are broken down into monomers in a process known as hydrolysis, which means “to split with water.” Hydrolysis is a reaction in which a water molecule is used during the breakdown of another compound (<link target-id="fs-id1167066086144"/>). During these reactions, the polymer is broken into two components: one part gains a hydrogen atom (H+) and the other gains a hydroxyl molecule (OH–) from a split water molecule.</para><figure id="fs-id1167066086144" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch03-s01-lo02"><media id="fs-id1405882" alt="Shown is the breakdown of maltose to form two glucose monomers.

<caption>In the hydrolysis reaction shown here, the disaccharide maltose is broken down to form two glucose monomers with the addition of a water molecule.

These reactions are similar for most macromolecules, but each monomer and polymer reaction is specific for its class. For example, in our bodies, food is hydrolyzed, or broken down, into smaller molecules by catalytic enzymes in the digestive system. This allows for easy absorption of nutrients by cells in the intestine. Each macromolecule is broken down by a specific enzyme. For instance, carbohydrates are broken down by amylase, sucrase, lactase, or maltase. Proteins are broken down by the enzymes pepsin and peptidase, and by hydrochloric acid. Lipids are broken down by lipases. Breakdown of these macromolecules provides energy for cellular activities.</para>

<title>Recreating Primordial Earth</title>
<para id="fs-id1167065891721">Many people wonder how life formed on Earth. In 1953, Stanley Miller and Harold Urey developed an apparatus like the one shown in <link target-id="figure_03_01_03"/> to model early conditions on earth. They wanted to test if organic molecules could form from simpler molecular precursors believed to exist very early in Earth’s history. They used boiling water to mimic early Earth’s oceans. Steam from the “ocean” combined with methane, ammonia, and hydrogen gases from the early Earth’s atmosphere and was exposed to electrical sparks to act as lightning. As the gas mixture cooled and condensed, it was found to contain organic compounds, such as amino acids and nucleotides. According to the abiogenesis theory, these organic molecules came together to form the earliest form of life about 3.5 billion years ago. (credit: Yassine Mrabet)</para>

Water is heated in a flask, and the steam is allowed to rise through a glass tube to a globe containing methane, ammonia and hydrogen gas, and where electrodes produce an electric spark. The gaseous mixture falls through a condenser, where it cools and becomes liquid. The cooled liquid is collected in a trap, where a sampling probe is inserted.">

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-id2334482">Proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and lipids are the four major classes of biological macromolecules—large molecules necessary for life that are built from smaller organic molecules. Macromolecules are made up of single units known as monomers that are joined by covalent bonds to form larger polymers. The polymer is more than the sum of its parts: it acquires new characteristics, and leads to an osmotic pressure that is much lower than that formed by its ingredients; this is an important advantage in the maintenance of cellular osmotic conditions. A monomer joins with another monomer with the release of a water molecule, leading to the formation of a covalent bond. These types of reactions are known as dehydration or condensation reactions. When polymers are broken down into smaller units (monomers), a molecule of water is used for each bond broken by these reactions; such reactions are known as hydrolysis reactions. Dehydration and hydrolysis reactions are similar for all macromolecules, but each monomer and polymer reaction is specific to its class. Dehydration reactions typically require an investment of energy for new bond formation, while hydrolysis reactions typically release energy by breaking bonds.</para></section>
