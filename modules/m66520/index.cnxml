<para id="fs-idm124513040">Although all life on earth shares various genetic similarities, only certain organisms combine genetic information by sexual reproduction and have offspring that can then successfully reproduce. Scientists call such organisms members of the same biological species.</para>
<section id="fs-idm122850816">
<title>Species and the Ability to Reproduce</title>
<para id="fs-idm16575136">A <term>species</term> is a group of individual organisms that interbreed and produce fertile, viable offspring. According to this definition, one species is distinguished from another when, in nature, it is not possible for matings between individuals from each species to produce fertile offspring.</para>
<para id="fs-idm96224336">Members of the same species share both external and internal characteristics, which develop from their DNA. The closer relationship two organisms share, the more DNA they have in common, just like people and their families. People’s DNA is likely to be more like their father or mother’s DNA than their cousin or grandparent’s DNA. Organisms of the same species have the highest level of DNA alignment and therefore share characteristics and behaviors that lead to successful reproduction.</para>
<para id="fs-idm101726640">Species’ appearance can be misleading in suggesting an ability or inability to mate. For example, even though domestic dogs (<emphasis effect="italics">Canis lupus familiaris</emphasis>) display phenotypic differences, such as size, build, and coat, most dogs can interbreed and produce viable puppies that can mature and sexually reproduce (<link target-id="fig-ch18_02_01" document=""/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm20379552">In other cases, individuals may appear similar although they are not members of the same species. For example, even though bald eagles (<emphasis effect="italics">Haliaeetus leucocephalus</emphasis>) and African fish eagles (<emphasis effect="italics">Haliaeetus vocifer</emphasis>) are both birds and eagles, each belongs to a separate species group (<link target-id="fig-ch18_02_02" document=""/>). If humans were to artificially intervene and fertilize a bald eagle's egg with an African fish eagle's sperm and a chick did hatch, that offspring, called a <term>hybrid</term> (a cross between two species), would probably be infertile—unable to successfully reproduce after it reached maturity. Different species may have different genes that are active in development; therefore, it may not be possible to develop a viable offspring with two different sets of directions. Thus, even though hybridization may take place, the two species still remain separate.</para>

Again, the basis to any changes in a group or population of organisms must be genetic for this is the only way to share and pass on traits. When variations occur within a species, they can only pass to the next generation along two main pathways: asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction. The change will pass on asexually simply if the reproducing cell possesses the changed trait. For the changed trait to pass on by sexual reproduction, a gamete, such as a sperm or egg cell, must possess the changed trait. In other words, sexually-reproducing organisms can experience several genetic changes in their body cells, but if these changes do not occur in a sperm or egg cell, the changed trait will never reach the next generation. Only heritable traits can evolve. Therefore, reproduction plays a paramount role for genetic change to take root in a population or species. In short, organisms must be able to reproduce with each other to pass new traits to offspring.</para></section>

<title>Speciation</title>
<para id="fs-idm99888736">The biological definition of species, which works for sexually reproducing organisms, is a group of actual or potential interbreeding individuals. There are exceptions to this rule. Many species are similar enough that hybrid offspring are possible and may often occur in nature, but for the majority of species this rule generally holds. The presence in nature of hybrids between similar species suggests that they may have descended from a single interbreeding species, and the speciation process may not yet be completed.</para>
<para id="fs-idm101597488">Given the extraordinary diversity of life on the planet there must be mechanisms for <term>speciation</term>: the formation of two species from one original species. Darwin envisioned this process as a branching event and diagrammed the process in the only illustration in <emphasis effect="italics">On the</emphasis> <emphasis effect="italics">Origin of Species</emphasis> (<link target-id="fig-ch18_02_03" document=""/>a). Compare this illustration to the diagram of elephant evolution (<link target-id="fig-ch18_02_03" document=""/>), which shows that as one species changes over time, it branches to form more than one new species, repeatedly, as long as the population survives or until the organism becomes extinct.</para>

These then are branched out as they move up across the page through fourteen rows labeled with Roman numerals. Some branches make a straight line from the bottom row to the top row, others keep branching out further at each row, and some are straight partway through the rows until they connect to an existing branch or form no connection and instead stop. The top four rows each consists of a single line from a branch tip; there are 6 branch tips at row X I; to one of 15 individual final designations. Illustration B shows the evolution of modern African and Asian elephants from a common ancestor, the Palaeomastodon. The Palaeomastodon was similar to modern elephants; however, it was smaller and had a long nose instead of a trunk. Side branches of the elephant evolutionary tree gave rise to mastodons and mammoths. The mammoth is more closely related to modern elephants than the mastodon.">

Biologists have proposed mechanisms by which this could occur that fall into two broad categories. <term>Allopatric speciation</term> (allo- = "other"; -patric = "homeland") involves geographic separation of populations from a parent species and subsequent evolution. <term>Sympatric speciation</term> (sym- = "same"; -patric = "homeland") involves speciation occurring within a parent species remaining in one location.</para>
<para id="fs-idm143545712">Biologists think of speciation events as the splitting of one ancestral species into two descendant species. There is no reason why more than two species might not form at one time except that it is less likely and we can conceptualize multiple events as single splits occurring close in time.</para>
</section>
<section id="fs-idm102039344">
<title>Allopatric Speciation</title>
<para id="fs-idm85041232">A geographically continuous population has a gene pool that is relatively homogeneous. Gene flow, the movement of alleles across a species' range, is relatively free because individuals can move and then mate with individuals in their new location. Thus, an allele's frequency at one end of a distribution will be similar to the allele's frequency at the other end. When populations become geographically discontinuous, it prevents alleles' free-flow. When that separation lasts for a period of time, the two populations are able to evolve along different trajectories. Thus, their allele frequencies at numerous genetic loci gradually become increasingly different as new alleles independently arise by mutation in each population. Typically, environmental conditions, such as climate, resources, predators, and competitors for the two populations will differ causing natural selection to favor divergent adaptations in each group.</para>
<para id="fs-idm93398672">Isolation of populations leading to allopatric speciation can occur in a variety of ways: a river forming a new branch, erosion creating a new valley, a group of organisms traveling to a new location without the ability to return, or seeds floating over the ocean to an island. The nature of the geographic separation necessary to isolate populations depends entirely on the organism's biology and its potential for dispersal. If two flying insect populations took up residence in separate nearby valleys, chances are, individuals from each population would fly back and forth continuing gene flow. However, if a new lake divided two rodent populations continued gene flow would be unlikely; therefore, speciation would be more likely.</para>
<para id="fs-idm104294672">Biologists group allopatric processes into two categories: dispersal and vicariance. <term>Dispersal</term> is when a few members of a species move to a new geographical area, and <term>vicariance</term> is when a natural situation arises to physically divide organisms.</para>
<para id="fs-idm103603056">Scientists have documented numerous cases of allopatric speciation taking place. For example, along the west coast of the United States, two separate spotted owl subspecies exist. The northern spotted owl has genetic and phenotypic differences from its close relative: the Mexican spotted owl, which lives in the south (<link target-id="fig-ch18_02_04" document=""/>).</para>
<figure id="fig-ch18_02_04"><media id="fs-idm138586416" alt="The northern spotted owl lives in the Pacific Northwest, and the Mexican spotted owl lives in Mexico and the southwestern portion of the United States. The two owls are similar in appearance but with slightly different coloration.">

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm98993792">Additionally, scientists have found that the further the distance between two groups that once were the same species, the more likely it is that speciation will occur. This seems logical because as the distance increases, the various environmental factors would likely have less in common than locations in close proximity. Consider the two owls: in the north, the climate is cooler than in the south. The types of organisms in each ecosystem differ, as do their behaviors and habits. Also, the hunting habits and prey choices of the southern owls vary from the northern owls. These variances can lead to evolved differences in the owls, and speciation likely will occur.</para>
<section id="fs-idm159382464">
<title>Adaptive Radiation</title>
<para id="fs-idm41089472">In some cases, a population of one species disperses throughout an area, and each finds a distinct niche or isolated habitat. Over time, the varied demands of their new lifestyles lead to multiple speciation events originating from a single species. We call this <term>adaptive radiation</term> because many adaptations evolve from a single point of origin; thus, causing the species to radiate into several new ones. Island archipelagos like the Hawaiian Islands provide an ideal context for adaptive radiation events because water surrounds each island which leads to geographical isolation for many organisms. The Hawaiian honeycreeper illustrates one example of adaptive radiation. From a single species, the founder species, numerous species have evolved, including the six in <link target-id="fig-ch18_02_05" document=""/>.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch18_02_05"><media id="fs-idm101597008" alt="The illustration shows a wheel with the founder species at the hub. The spokes of the wheel are six modern honeycreeper bird species that evolved from the founder bird species.

The Nihoa Finch has a short, fat beak and eats insects, seeds, and bird eggs.">

Evolution in response to natural selection based on specific food sources in each new habitat led to evolution of a different beak suited to the specific food source. The seed-eating bird has a thicker, stronger beak which is suited to break hard nuts. The nectar-eating birds have long beaks to dip into flowers to reach the nectar. The insect-eating birds have beaks like swords, appropriate for stabbing and impaling insects. Darwin’s finches are another example of adaptive radiation in an archipelago.</para>

<title>Sympatric Speciation</title>
<para id="fs-idm201779952">Can divergence occur if no physical barriers are in place to separate individuals who continue to live and reproduce in the same habitat? The answer is yes. We call the process of speciation within the same space sympatric. The prefix “sym” means same, so “sympatric” means “same homeland” in contrast to “allopatric” meaning “other homeland.” Scientists have proposed and studied many mechanisms.</para>
<para id="fs-idm174791120">One form of sympatric speciation can begin with a serious chromosomal error during cell division. In a normal cell division event chromosomes replicate, pair up, and then separate so that each new cell has the same number of chromosomes. However, sometimes the pairs separate and the end cell product has too many or too few individual chromosomes in a condition that we call <emphasis effect="bold">aneuploidy </emphasis>(<link target-id="fig-ch18_02_06" document=""/>).</para>

</note>
<para id="fs-idm110753248">Polyploidy is a condition in which a cell or organism has an extra set, or sets, of chromosomes. Scientists have identified two main types of polyploidy that can lead to reproductive isolation of an individual in the polyploidy state. Reproductive isolation is the inability to interbreed. In some cases, a polyploid individual will have two or more complete sets of chromosomes from its own species in a condition that we call <term>autopolyploidy</term> (<link target-id="fig-ch18_02_07" document=""/>). The prefix “auto-” means “self,” so the term means multiple chromosomes from one’s own species. Polyploidy results from an error in meiosis in which all of the chromosomes move into one cell instead of separating.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch18_02_07"><media id="fs-idp11713120" alt="Autopolyploidy results in offspring with two sets of chromosomes. In the example shown, a diploid parent, 2 n produces polyploid offspring 4 n.">

</media>

<caption>Autopolyploidy results when mitosis is not followed by cytokinesis.</caption></figure><para id="fs-idm121334384">For example, if a plant species with 2<emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> = 6 produces autopolyploid gametes that are also diploid (2<emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> = 6, when they should be <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> = 3), the gametes now have twice as many chromosomes as they should have. These new gametes will be incompatible with the normal gametes that this plant species produces. However, they could either self-pollinate or reproduce with other autopolyploid plants with gametes having the same diploid number. In this way, sympatric speciation can occur quickly by forming offspring with 4<emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> that we call a tetraploid. These individuals would immediately be able to reproduce only with those of this new kind and not those of the ancestral species.</para>
<para id="fs-idm78071504">The other form of polyploidy occurs when individuals of two different species reproduce to form a viable offspring that we call an <term>allopolyploid</term>. The prefix “allo-” means “other” (recall from allopatric): therefore, an allopolyploid occurs when gametes from two different species combine. <link target-id="fig-ch18_02_08" document=""/> illustrates one possible way an allopolyploid can form. Notice how it takes two generations, or two reproductive acts, before the viable fertile hybrid results.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch18_02_08"><media id="fs-idm105632032" alt="Alloploidy results from viable matings between two species with different numbers of chromosomes. In the example shown, species one has three pairs of chromosomes, and species two has two pairs of chromosomes. When a normal gamete from species one (with three chromosomes) fuses with a polyploidy gamete from species two (with two pairs of chromosomes), a zygote with seven chromosomes results. An offspring from this mating produces a polyploid gamete, with seven chromosomes. If this polyploid gamete fuses with a normal gamete from species one, with three chromosomes, the resulting offspring will have ten viable chromosomes.">

Two matings are necessary to produce viable offspring.</caption></figure><para id="fs-idm143595856">The cultivated forms of wheat, cotton, and tobacco plants are all allopolyploids. Although polyploidy occurs occasionally in animals, it takes place most commonly in plants. (Animals with any of the types of chromosomal aberrations that we describe here are unlikely to survive and produce normal offspring.) Scientists have discovered more than half of all plant species studied relate back to a species evolved through polyploidy. With such a high rate of polyploidy in plants, some scientists hypothesize that this mechanism takes place more as an adaptation than as an error.</para>

<section id="fs-idp23048320">
<title>Reproductive Isolation</title>
<para id="fs-idm72065376">Given enough time, the genetic and phenotypic divergence between populations will affect characters that influence reproduction: if individuals of the two populations were brought together, mating would be less likely, but if mating occurred, offspring would be nonviable or infertile. Many types of diverging characters may affect the <term>reproductive isolation</term>, the ability to interbreed, of the two populations.</para>
<para id="fs-idm219191376">Reproductive isolation can take place in a variety of ways. Scientists organize them into two groups: prezygotic barriers and postzygotic barriers. Recall that a zygote is a fertilized egg: the first cell of an organism's development that reproduces sexually. Therefore, a <term>prezygotic barrier</term> is a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place. This includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction. A <term>postzygotic barrier</term> occurs after zygote formation. This includes organisms that don’t survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile.</para>
<para id="fs-idm28981696">Some types of prezygotic barriers prevent reproduction entirely. Many organisms only reproduce at certain times of the year, often just annually. Differences in breeding schedules, which we call <term>temporal isolation</term>, can act as a form of reproductive isolation. For example, two frog species inhabit the same area, but one reproduces from January to March; whereas, the other reproduces from March to May (<link target-id="fig-ch18_02_09" document=""/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm172096544">In some cases, populations of a species move or are moved to a new habitat and take up residence in a place that no longer overlaps with the same species' other populations. We call this situation <term>habitat isolation</term>. Reproduction with the parent species ceases, and a new group exists that is now reproductively and genetically independent. For example, a cricket population that was divided after a flood could no longer interact with each other. Over time, natural selection forces, mutation, and genetic drift will likely result in the two groups diverging (<link target-id="fig-ch18_02_10" document=""/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm37073552"><term>Behavioral isolation</term> occurs when the presence or absence of a specific behavior prevents reproduction. For example, male fireflies use specific light patterns to attract females. Various firefly species display their lights differently. If a male of one species tried to attract the female of another, she would not recognize the light pattern and would not mate with the male.</para>
<para id="fs-idm88784624">Other prezygotic barriers work when differences in their gamete cells (eggs and sperm) prevent fertilization from taking place. We call this a <term>gametic barrier</term>. Similarly, in some cases closely related organisms try to mate, but their reproductive structures simply do not fit together. For example, damselfly males of different species have differently shaped reproductive organs. If one species tries to mate with the female of another, their body parts simply do not fit together.

Therefore, the organisms are unable to reproduce offspring of their own. We call this hybrid sterility.</para>

<title>Habitat Influence on Speciation</title>
<para id="fs-idm120115328">Sympatric speciation may also take place in ways other than polyploidy. For example, consider a fish species that lives in a lake. As the population grows, competition for food increases. Under pressure to find food, suppose that a group of these fish had the genetic flexibility to discover and feed off another resource that other fish did not use. What if this new food source was located at a different depth of the lake? Over time, those feeding on the second food source would interact more with each other than the other fish; therefore, they would breed together as well. Offspring of these fish would likely behave as their parents: feeding and living in the same area and keeping separate from the original population. If this group of fish continued to remain separate from the first population, eventually sympatric speciation might occur as more genetic differences accumulated between them.</para>
<para id="fs-idm53402816">This scenario does play out in nature, as do others that lead to reproductive isolation. One such place is Lake Victoria in Africa, famous for its sympatric speciation of cichlid fish.

<caption>Cichlid fish from Lake Apoyeque, Nicaragua, show evidence of sympatric speciation. Lake Apoyeque, a crater lake, is 1800 years old, but genetic evidence indicates that a single population of cichlid fish populated the lake only 100 years ago. Nevertheless, two populations with distinct morphologies and diets now exist in the lake, and scientists believe these populations may be in an early stage of speciation.</caption>

<title>Section Summary</title>
<para id="fs-idm19052624">Speciation occurs along two main pathways: geographic separation (allopatric speciation) and through mechanisms that occur within a shared habitat (sympatric speciation). Both pathways isolate a population reproductively in some form. Mechanisms of reproductive isolation act as barriers between closely related species, enabling them to diverge and exist as genetically independent species. Prezygotic barriers block reproduction prior to formation of a zygote; whereas, postzygotic barriers block reproduction after fertilization occurs. For a new species to develop, something must introduce a reproductive barrier. Sympatric speciation can occur through errors in meiosis that form gametes with extra chromosomes (polyploidy). Autopolyploidy occurs within a single species; whereas, allopolyploidy occurs between closely related species.</para></section>
