  <md:title>Preface</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Biology is designed for multi-semester biology courses for science majors. It is grounded on an evolutionary basis and includes exciting features that highlight careers in the biological sciences and everyday applications of the concepts at hand. To meet the needs of today’s instructors and students, some content has been strategically condensed while maintaining the overall scope and coverage of traditional texts for this course. Instructors can customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom. Biology also includes an innovative art program that incorporates critical thinking and clicker questions to help students understand—and apply—key concepts.</md:abstract>

<title>About OpenStax</title>
<para id="import-auto-id1164193596448">OpenStax is a nonprofit based at Rice University, and it’s our mission to improve student access to education. Our first openly licensed college textbook was published in 2012, and our library has since scaled to over 25 books for college and AP<sup>®</sup> courses used by hundreds of thousands of students. OpenStax Tutor, our low-cost personalized learning tool, is being used in college courses throughout the country. Through our partnerships with philanthropic foundations and our alliance with other educational resource organizations, OpenStax is breaking down the most common barriers to learning and empowering students and instructors to succeed.</para>

<title>About <emphasis effect="italics">Biology 2e</emphasis></title>
<para id="import-auto-id1164231453381"><emphasis effect="italics">Biology 2e</emphasis> (2nd edition) is designed to cover the scope and sequence requirements of a typical two-semester biology course for science majors. The text provides comprehensive coverage of foundational research and core biology concepts through an evolutionary lens. <emphasis effect="italics">Biology</emphasis> includes rich features that engage students in scientific inquiry, highlight careers in the biological sciences, and offer everyday applications. The book also includes various types of practice and homework questions that help students understand — and apply — key concepts.</para><para id="para001">The 2<sup>nd</sup> edition has been revised to incorporate clearer, more current, and more dynamic explanations, while maintaining the same organization as the first edition. Art and illustrations have been substantially improved, and the textbook features additional assessments and related resources.</para>

<title>Coverage and scope</title>
<para id="import-auto-id1164221149313"><emphasis effect="italics">Biology</emphasis> was one of the first textbooks published by OpenStax and has been used by hundreds of faculty and thousands of students since 2012. We mined our adopters’ extensive and helpful feedback to identify the most significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated into their courses. Specific surveys, focus groups, and pre-revision reviews, as well as data from our OpenStax Tutor users, all aided in planning the revision.</para>
<para id="import-auto-id1164201876325">The result is a book that thoroughly treats biology’s foundational concepts while adding current and meaningful coverage in specific areas. <emphasis effect="italics">Biology 2e</emphasis> retains its manageable scope and contains ample features to draw learners into the discipline.</para>
<para id="import-auto-id1164185871638">Structurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted changes at the section level (mostly in biodiversity).</para>
<list id="import-auto-id1164187852653" list-type="bulleted"><item><emphasis effect="bold">Unit 1: The Chemistry of Life.</emphasis> Our opening unit introduces students to the sciences, including the scientific method, bioethics, and the fundamental concepts of chemistry and physics that provide a framework within which learners comprehend biological processes.</item>

<title>Changes to the Second Edition</title>
<para id="para002">OpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case of <emphasis effect="italics">Biology 2e</emphasis>, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in the following ways:</para>
<list id="import-auto-id1164187855362" list-type="bulleted"><item><emphasis effect="bold">Content revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currency.</emphasis> The revision plan varied by chapter based on need. About twenty chapters were wholly revised with significant updates to conceptual coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In about fifteen other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on readability and clearer language with fewer conceptual and factual changes.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Additional end-of-chapter questions.</emphasis> The authors added new assessments to nearly every chapter, including both review and critical thinking questions. The additions total over 350 new items.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Art and illustrations.</emphasis> Under the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes to most of the art in <emphasis effect="italics">Biology</emphasis>. You will find examples in the section below. The revisions fall into the following categories:
<list id="import-auto-id1164187855363" list-type="bulleted"><item>Revisions for accuracy</item>
<item>Redesigns for greater understanding and impact</item>
<item>Recoloring art for overall consistency and representation</item>
</list></item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Accessibility improvements.</emphasis> As with all OpenStax books, the first edition of <emphasis effect="italics">Biology</emphasis> was created with a focus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition.
<list id="import-auto-id1164187856353" list-type="bulleted">
<item>To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.</item>
