<title>Plant Parasites and Pathogens</title>
<para id="fs-idm142150304">The production of sufficient high-quality crops is essential to human existence. Unfortunately, plant diseases have ruined many crops throughout human agricultural history, sometimes creating widespread famine. Many plant pathogens are fungi that cause tissue decay and the eventual death of the host (<link target-id="fig-ch24_04_01abcd"/>). In addition to destroying plant tissue directly, some plant pathogens spoil crops by producing potent toxins that can further damage and kill the host plant. Fungi are also responsible for food spoilage and the rotting of stored crops. For example, the fungus <emphasis effect="italics">Claviceps purpurea</emphasis> causes ergot, a disease of cereal crops (especially of rye). Although the fungus reduces the yield of cereals, the effects of the ergot's alkaloid toxins on humans and animals are of much greater significance. In animals, the disease is referred to as <emphasis effect="italics">ergotism</emphasis>. The most common signs and symptoms are convulsions, hallucination, gangrene, and loss of milk in cattle. The active ingredient of ergot is <emphasis effect="italics">lysergic acid</emphasis>, which is a precursor of the drug LSD. Smuts, rusts, and powdery or downy mildew are other examples of common fungal pathogens that affect crops.</para>

<title>Animal and Human Parasites and Pathogens</title>
<para id="fs-idm113124880">Fungi can affect animals, including humans, in several ways. A <term id="term-00003">mycosis</term> is a fungal disease that results from infection and direct damage due to the growth and infiltration of the fungus. Fungi attack animals directly by colonizing and destroying tissues. <term id="term-00004">Mycotoxicosis</term> is the poisoning of humans (and other animals) by foods contaminated by fungal toxins (mycotoxins). <term id="term-00005">Mycetismus</term> specifically describes the ingestion of preformed toxins in poisonous mushrooms. In addition, individuals who display hypersensitivity to molds and spores may develop strong and dangerous allergic reactions. Fungal infections are generally very difficult to treat because, unlike bacteria, fungi are eukaryotes. Antibiotics only target prokaryotic cells, whereas compounds that kill fungi also harm the eukaryotic animal host.</para><para id="fs-idm186471888">Many fungal infections are <emphasis effect="italics">superficial</emphasis>; that is, they occur on the animal’s skin. Termed <emphasis effect="italics">cutaneous</emphasis> (“skin”) <emphasis effect="italics">mycoses</emphasis>, they can have devastating effects. For example, the decline of the world’s frog population in recent years is caused (in part) by the chytrid fungus <emphasis effect="italics">Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</emphasis>. This deadly fungus infects the skin of frogs and presumably interferes with cutaneous gaseous exchange, which is essential for amphibian survival. Similarly, more than a million bats in the United States have been killed by white-nose syndrome, which appears as a white ring around the mouth of the bat. It is caused by the cold-loving fungus <emphasis effect="italics">Pseudogymnoascus destructans</emphasis>, which disseminates its deadly spores in caves where bats hibernate. Mycologists are researching the transmission, mechanism, and control of <emphasis effect="italics">P. destructans</emphasis> to stop its spread.</para><para id="fs-idm175923184">Fungi that cause the superficial mycoses of the epidermis, hair, and nails rarely spread to the underlying tissue (<link target-id="fig-ch24_04_02abc"/>). These fungi are often misnamed “dermatophytes”, from the Greek words <emphasis effect="italics">dermis</emphasis> meaning skin and<emphasis effect="italics"> phyte</emphasis> meaning plant, although they are not plants. Dermatophytes are also called <emphasis effect="italics">“ringworms”</emphasis> because of the red ring they cause on skin. They secrete extracellular enzymes that break down <emphasis effect="italics">keratin</emphasis> (a protein found in hair, skin, and nails), causing conditions such as athlete’s foot and jock itch. These conditions are usually treated with over-the-counter topical creams and powders, and are easily cleared. More persistent superficial mycoses may require prescription oral medications.</para>

Renz, CDC; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)</caption></figure><para id="fs-idm77378176"><emphasis effect="italics">Systemic mycoses</emphasis> spread to internal organs, most commonly entering the body through the respiratory system. For example, <emphasis effect="italics">coccidioidomycosis</emphasis> (often called valley fever) is commonly found in the southwestern United States, but as far north as Washington, where the fungus resides in the dust. Once inhaled, the spores develop in the lungs and cause symptoms similar to those of tuberculosis. <emphasis effect="italics">Histoplasmosis</emphasis> is caused by the dimorphic fungus <emphasis effect="italics">Histoplasma capsulatum.</emphasis> In its human host, <emphasis effect="italics">Histoplasma</emphasis> grows as a yeast, causing pulmonary infections, and in rarer cases, swelling of the membranes of the brain and spinal cord. Treatment of these and many other fungal diseases requires the use of antifungal medications that have serious side effects.</para>
<para id="fs-idm55827760">Opportunistic mycoses are fungal infections that are either common in all environments, or part of the normal biota. They mainly affect individuals who have a compromised immune system. Patients in the late stages of AIDS suffer from opportunistic mycoses that can be life threatening. The yeast <emphasis effect="italics">Candida</emphasis> sp., a common member of the natural biota, can grow unchecked and infect the vagina or mouth (oral thrush) if the pH of the surrounding environment, the person’s immune defenses, or the normal population of bacteria are altered.</para>
<para id="fs-idm142192576"><emphasis effect="italics">Mycetismus</emphasis> can occur when poisonous mushrooms are eaten. It causes a number of human fatalities during mushroom-picking season. Many edible fruiting bodies of fungi resemble highly poisonous relatives, and amateur mushroom hunters are cautioned to carefully inspect their harvest and avoid eating mushrooms of doubtful origin. The adage “there are bold mushroom pickers and old mushroom pickers, but are there no old, bold mushroom pickers” is unfortunately true.</para>

<para id="fs-idm96939104"><emphasis>Hypothesis</emphasis>: Construct a hypothesis that addresses this question.</para>
<para id="fs-idm186901328"><emphasis>Background</emphasis>: Dutch elm disease is a fungal infestation that affects many species of elm (<emphasis effect="italics">Ulmus</emphasis>) in North America. The fungus infects the vascular system of the tree, which blocks water flow within the plant and mimics drought stress. Accidently introduced to the United States in the early 1930s, it decimated American elm shade trees across the continent. It is caused by the fungus<emphasis effect="italics"> Ophiostoma ulmi</emphasis>. The elm bark beetle acts as a vector and transmits the disease from tree to tree. Many European and Asiatic elms are less susceptible to the disease than are American elms.</para>
<para id="fs-idm178135776"><emphasis>Test the hypothesis</emphasis>: A researcher testing this hypothesis might do the following. Inoculate several Petri plates containing a medium that supports the growth of fungi with fragments of <emphasis effect="italics">Ophiostoma</emphasis> mycelium. Cut (with a metal punch) several disks from the vascular tissue of susceptible varieties of American elms and resistant European and Asiatic elms. Include control Petri plates inoculated with mycelia without plant tissue to verify that the medium and incubation conditions do not interfere with fungal growth. As a positive control, add paper disks impregnated with a known fungicide to Petri plates inoculated with the mycelium.</para>
<para id="fs-idm126922864">Incubate the plates for a set number of days to allow fungal growth and spreading of the mycelium over the surface of the plate. Record the diameter of the zone of clearing, if any, around the tissue samples and the fungicide control disk.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-idm63356416">Fungi establish parasitic relationships with plants and animals. Fungal diseases can decimate crops and spoil food during storage. Compounds produced by fungi can be toxic to humans and other animals. Mycoses are infections caused by fungi. Superficial mycoses affect the skin, whereas systemic mycoses spread through the body. Fungal infections are difficult to cure, since fungi, like their hosts, are eukaryotic, and cladistically related closely to Kingdom Animalia.</para>

The Red Queen Hypothesis describes the biological stalemate between a predator and prey.
