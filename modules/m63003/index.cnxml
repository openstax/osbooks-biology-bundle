<title>Connection for AP<sup>®</sup> Courses</title>
<para id="fs-id1167062468539">Much information in this section is outside the scope for AP<sup>®</sup>. However, the concepts provide an opportunity to apply concepts explored in previous chapters, including chemistry. Of the four macromolecules in biological systems, both proteins and nucleic acids contain nitrogen. During the breakdown (catabolism) of nitrogen-containing macromolecules, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are extracted and stored in the form of carbohydrates and fats. However, excess nitrogen must be excreted from the body because nitrogenous wastes tend to form toxic <emphasis>ammonia</emphasis>, which raises the pH of body fluids and disrupts homeostasis. The formation of toxic ammonia requires energy in the form of ATP and large quantities of water to dilute it out of a biological system. Aquatic animals, such as fishes, can release ammonia directly into the environment. Animals that excrete ammonia are said to be <emphasis>ammonotelic</emphasis>. Terrestrial animals, including mammals, must detoxify ammonia by converting it into relatively nontoxic forms such as uric acid or urea. Animals that secrete urea as the primary nitrogenous waste material are called <emphasis>ureotelic</emphasis> animals. Birds and reptiles excrete uric acid, a water-insoluble form of nitrogenous waste, thus reducing water loss. From an evolutionary standpoint, life likely started in an aquatic environment, so it not surprising that biochemical pathways like the conversion of ammonia to urea typical in mammals evolved to adapt to terrestrial conditions; more arid conditions probably led to the evolution of the uric acid pathway as a means of conserving water.</para>

<title>Nitrogenous Waste in Terrestrial Animals: The Urea Cycle</title>
<para id="fs-idp71399856">The <emphasis>urea cycle</emphasis> is the primary mechanism by which mammals convert ammonia to urea. Urea is made in the liver and excreted in urine. The overall chemical reaction by which ammonia is converted to urea is 2 NH<sub>3</sub> (ammonia) + CO<sub>2</sub> + 3 ATP + H<sub>2</sub>O → H<sub>2</sub>N-CO-NH<sub>2</sub> (urea) + 2 ADP + 4 P<sub>i</sub> + AMP.
</para><para id="fs-idp160881968">The urea cycle utilizes five intermediate steps, catalyzed by five different enzymes, to convert ammonia to urea, as shown in <link target-id="fig-ch41_04_01"/>. The amino acid L-ornithine gets converted into different intermediates before being regenerated at the end of the urea cycle. Hence, the urea cycle is also referred to as the ornithine cycle. The enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase catalyzes a key step in the urea cycle and its deficiency can lead to accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia in the body. The first two reactions occur in the mitochondria and the last three reactions occur in the cytosol. Urea concentration in the blood, called <emphasis>blood urea nitrogen</emphasis> or BUN, is used as an indicator of kidney function.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch41_04_01" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch32-s04-lo01"><media id="fs-idp154768224" alt="The urea cycle begins in the mitochondrion, where bicarbonate (HCO3) is combined with ammonia (NH3) to make carbamoyl phosphate. Two ATP are used in the process. Ornithine transcarbamylase adds the carbamoyl phosphate to a five-carbon amino acid called ornithine to make L-citrulline. L-citrulline leaves the mitochondrion, and an enzyme called arginosuccinate synthetase adds a four-carbon amino acid called L-aspartate to it to make arginosuccinate. In the process, one ATP is converted to AMP and PPi. Arginosuccinate lyase removes a four-carbon fumarate molecule from the arginosuccinate, forming the six-carbon amino acid L-arginine. Arginase-1 removes a urea molecule from the L-arginine, forming ornithine in the process. Urea has a single carbon double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to two ammonia groups. Ornithine enters the mitochondrion, completing the cycle.">

<title>Nitrogenous Waste in Birds and Reptiles: Uric Acid</title>
<para id="fs-idp105475568">Birds, reptiles, and most terrestrial arthropods convert toxic ammonia to <emphasis>uric acid</emphasis> or the closely related compound guanine (guano) instead of urea. Mammals also form some uric acid during breakdown of nucleic acids. Uric acid is a compound similar to purines found in nucleic acids. It is water insoluble and tends to form a white paste or powder; it is excreted by birds, insects, and reptiles.

<para id="fs-idp722544">Mammals use uric acid crystals as an <emphasis>antioxidant</emphasis> in their cells. However, too much uric acid tends to form kidney stones and may also cause a painful condition called gout, where uric acid crystals accumulate in the joints, as illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch41_04_03"/>. Food choices that reduce the amount of nitrogenous bases in the diet help reduce the risk of gout. For example, tea, coffee, and chocolate have purine-like compounds, called xanthines, and should be avoided by people with gout and kidney stones.</para>
