<para id="fs-idm200418880">The DNA of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome, supercoiled within the nucleoid region of the cell cytoplasm. Proteins that are needed for a specific function, or that are involved in the same biochemical pathway, are encoded together in blocks called <term id="term-00001">operons</term>. For example, all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each other in the lactose (or <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis>) operon, and transcribed into a single mRNA.</para>
<para id="fs-idm204458112">In prokaryotic cells, there are three types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of operons: repressors, activators, and inducers. Repressors and activators are proteins produced in the cell. Both repressors and activators regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA sites <emphasis effect="italics">adjacent</emphasis> to the genes they control. <emphasis effect="italics">In general, activators bind to the promoter site, while repressors bind to operator regions</emphasis>. <term id="term-00002">Repressors</term> prevent transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus, whereas <term id="term-00003">activators</term> increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus. <term id="term-00012">Inducers</term> are small molecules that> may be produced by the cell or that are in the cell’s environment. Inducers either activate or repress transcription depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of substrate.</para>

<title>The <emphasis effect="italics">trp</emphasis> Operon: A Repressible Operon</title>
<para id="fs-idm166815232">Bacteria such as <emphasis effect="italics">Escherichia coli</emphasis> need amino acids to survive, and are able to synthesize many of them. <term id="term-00004">Tryptophan</term> is one such amino acid that <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> can either ingest from the environment or synthesize using enzymes that are encoded by five genes. These five genes are next to each other in what is called the <term id="term-00005">tryptophan (<emphasis effect="italics">trp</emphasis>) operon</term> (<link target-id="fig-ch16_02_01"/>). The genes are transcribed into a single mRNA, which is then translated to produce all five enzymes. If tryptophan is present in the environment, then <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> does not need to synthesize it and the <emphasis effect="italics">trp</emphasis> operon is switched off. However, when tryptophan availability is low, the switch controlling the operon is turned on, the mRNA is transcribed, the enzyme proteins are translated, and tryptophan is synthesized.</para>

R N A polymerase binds to the promoter. When tryptophan is present, the t r p repressor binds the operator and prevents the R N A polymerase from moving past the operator; therefore, R N A synthesis is blocked. In the absence of tryptophan, the repressor dissociates from the operator. R N A polymerase can now slide past the operator, and transcription begins.">

When tryptophan is absent, the repressor protein does not bind to the operator and the genes are transcribed.</caption></figure><para id="fs-idm174533984">The <emphasis effect="italics">trp</emphasis> operon includes three important regions: the coding region, the <emphasis effect="italics">trp</emphasis> operator and the <emphasis effect="italics">trp</emphasis> promoter. The coding region includes the genes for the five tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes. Just before the coding region is the <term id="term-00006">transcriptional start site</term>.

<title>Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP): A Transcriptional Activator</title>
    <para id="fs-idm148740496">Just as the <emphasis effect="italics">trp</emphasis> operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules, there are proteins that bind to the promoter sequences that act as <term id="term-00009">positive regulators</term> to turn genes on and activate them. For example, when glucose is scarce, <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> bacteria can turn to other sugar sources for fuel. To do this, new genes to process these alternate sugars must be transcribed. When glucose levels drop, cyclic AMP (cAMP) begins to accumulate in the cell. The cAMP molecule is a signaling molecule that is involved in glucose and energy metabolism in <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis>. Accumulating cAMP binds to the positive regulator <term id="term-00010">catabolite activator protein (CAP)</term>, a protein that binds to the promoters of operons which control the processing of alternative sugars. When cAMP binds to CAP, the complex then binds to the promoter region of the genes that are needed to use the alternate sugar sources (<link target-id="fig-ch16_02_02"/>). In these operons, a CAP-binding site is located upstream of the RNA-polymerase-binding site in the promoter. CAP binding stabilizes the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter region and increases transcription of the associated protein-coding genes.</para>

<title>The <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> Operon: An Inducible Operon</title>
<para id="fs-idm17029296">The third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through <emphasis effect="italics">inducible operons</emphasis>, which have proteins that bind to activate or repress transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell. The <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operon is a typical inducible operon. As mentioned previously, <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> is able to use other sugars as energy sources when glucose concentrations are low. One such sugar source is lactose. The <term id="term-00011"><emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operon</term> encodes the genes necessary to acquire and process the lactose from the local environment. The Z gene of the <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operon encodes beta-galactosidase, which breaks lactose down to glucose and galactose.</para><para id="fs-idm17030296">However, for the <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operon to be activated, two conditions must be met. First, the level of glucose must be very low or non-existent. Second, lactose must be present. Only when glucose is absent and lactose is present will the <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operon be transcribed (<link target-id="fig-ch16_02_03"/>). In the absence of glucose, the binding of the CAP protein makes transcription of the <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operon more effective.  When lactose is present, its metabolite, allolactose, binds to the <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> repressor and changes its shape so that it cannot bind to the <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operator to prevent transcription. This combination of conditions makes sense for the cell, because it would be energetically wasteful to synthesize the enzymes to process lactose if
glucose was plentiful or lactose was not available. It should be mentioned that the lac operon is transcribed at a very low rate even when glucose is present and lactose absent.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-idm214780208">The regulation of gene expression in prokaryotic cells occurs at the transcriptional level. There are two majors kinds of proteins that control prokaryotic transcription: repressors and activators. Repressors bind to an operator region to block the action of RNA polymerase. Activators bind to the promoter to enhance the binding of RNA polymerase. Inducer molecules can increase transcription either by inactivating repressors or by activating activator proteins. In the <emphasis effect="italics">trp</emphasis> operon, the <emphasis effect="italics">trp</emphasis> repressor is itself activated by binding to tryptophan. Therefore, if tryptophan is not needed, the repressor is bound to the operator and transcription remains off. The <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operon is activated by the CAP (catabolite activator protein), which binds to the promoter to stabilize RNA polymerase binding. CAP is itself activated by cAMP, whose concentration rises as the concentration of glucose falls. However, the <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operon also requires the presence of lactose for transcription to occur. Lactose inactivates the <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> repressor, and prevents the repressor protein from binding to the <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operator. With the repressor inactivated, transcription may proceed. Therefore glucose must be absent and lactose must be present for effective transcription of the <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operon.</para>
