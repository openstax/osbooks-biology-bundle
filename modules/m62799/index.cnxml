These cascades are complex because of the interplay between proteins. A significant contributor to cell signaling cascades is the phosphorylation of molecules by enzymes known as kinases. (Substrate–level phosphorylation was studied when you learned about glycolysis.) By adding a phosphate group, phosphorylation changes the shapes of proteins. This change in shape activates or inactivates them. Second messengers, e.g., cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, are often used to transmit signals within a cell.</para>

Continuation of a signal in this manner is called <term id="term-00001">signal transduction</term>. Signal transduction only occurs with cell-surface receptors because internal receptors are able to interact directly with DNA in the nucleus to initiate protein synthesis.</para>
<para id="fs-id1511912">When a ligand binds to its receptor, conformational changes occur that affect the receptor’s intracellular domain. Conformational changes of the extracellular domain upon ligand binding can propagate through the membrane region of the receptor and lead to activation of the intracellular domain or its associated proteins. In some cases, binding of the ligand causes <term id="term-00002">dimerization</term> of the receptor, which means that two receptors bind to each other to form a stable complex called a dimer. A <term id="term-00003">dimer</term> is a chemical compound formed when two molecules (often identical) join together. The binding of the receptors in this manner enables their intracellular domains to come into close contact and activate each other.</para>

<title>Binding Initiates a Signaling Pathway</title>
<para id="fs-id2572263">After the ligand binds to the cell-surface receptor, the activation of the receptor’s intracellular components sets off a chain of events that is called a <term id="term-00004">signaling pathway</term> or a signaling cascade. In a signaling pathway, second messengers, enzymes, and activated proteins interact with specific proteins, which are in turn activated in a chain reaction that eventually leads to a change in the cell’s environment (<link target-id="fig-ch09_02_01"/>). The events in the cascade occur in a series, much like a current flows in a river. Interactions that occur before a certain point are defined as upstream events, and events after that point are called downstream events.</para>

</note><para id="fs-id2890952">Signaling pathways can get very complicated very quickly because most cellular proteins can affect different downstream events, depending on the conditions within the cell. A single pathway can branch off toward different endpoints based on the interplay between two or more signaling pathways, and the same ligands are often used to initiate different signals in different cell types. This variation in response is due to differences in protein expression in different cell types. Another complicating element is <term id="term-00005">signal integration</term> of the pathways, in which signals from two or more different cell-surface receptors merge to activate the same response in the cell. This process can ensure that multiple external requirements are met before a cell commits to a specific response.</para>
<para id="fs-id1368373">The effects of extracellular signals can also be amplified by enzymatic cascades. At the initiation of the signal, a single ligand binds to a single receptor. However, activation of a receptor-linked enzyme can activate many copies of a component of the signaling cascade, which amplifies the signal.</para>

<title>Phosphorylation</title>
<para id="fs-id2198400">One of the most common chemical modifications that occurs in signaling pathways is the addition of a phosphate group (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>–3</sup>) to a molecule such as a protein in a process called phosphorylation. The phosphate can be added to a nucleotide such as GMP to form GDP or GTP. Phosphates are also often added to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues of proteins, where they replace the hydroxyl group of the amino acid (<link target-id="fig-ch09_02_02"/>). The transfer of the phosphate is catalyzed by an enzyme called a <term id="term-00006">kinase</term>. Various kinases are named for the substrate they phosphorylate. Phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues often activates enzymes. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues can either affect the activity of an enzyme or create a binding site that interacts with downstream components in the signaling cascade. Phosphorylation may activate or inactivate enzymes, and the reversal of phosphorylation, dephosphorylation by a phosphatase, will reverse the effect.</para>

<title>Second Messengers</title>
<para id="fs-id1465975"><term id="term-00007">Second messengers</term> are small molecules that propagate a signal after it has been initiated by the binding of the signaling molecule to the receptor. These molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by altering the behavior of certain cellular proteins.</para>
<para id="fs-id2571182">Calcium ion is a widely used second messenger. The free concentration of calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) within a cell is very low because ion pumps in the plasma membrane continuously use adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) to remove it. For signaling purposes, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, or accessed from outside the cell. When signaling occurs, ligand-gated calcium ion channels allow the higher levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> that are present outside the cell (or in intracellular storage compartments) to flow into the cytoplasm, which raises the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The response to the increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> varies, depending on the cell type involved. For example, in the β-cells of the pancreas, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling leads to the release of insulin, and in muscle cells, an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> leads to muscle contractions.</para><para id="fs-id1511305">Another second messenger utilized in many different cell types is <term id="term-00008">cyclic AMP (cAMP)</term>. Cyclic AMP is synthesized by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase from ATP (<link target-id="fig-ch09_02_03"/>). The main role of cAMP in cells is to bind to and activate an enzyme called <term id="term-00009">cAMP-dependent kinase (A-kinase)</term>. A-kinase regulates many vital metabolic pathways: It phosphorylates serine and threonine residues of its target proteins, activating them in the process. A-kinase is found in many different types of cells, and the target proteins in each kind of cell are different. Differences give rise to the variation of the responses to cAMP in different cells.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-id2763338">Ligand binding to the receptor allows for signal transduction through the cell. The chain of events that conveys the signal through the cell is called a signaling pathway or cascade. Signaling pathways are often very complex because of the interplay between different proteins. A major component of cell signaling cascades is the phosphorylation of molecules by enzymes known as kinases. Phosphorylation adds a phosphate group to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues in a protein, changing their shapes, and activating or inactivating the protein. Small molecules like nucleotides can also be phosphorylated. Second messengers are small, non-protein molecules that are used to transmit a signal within a cell. Some examples of second messengers are calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), cyclic AMP (cAMP), diacylglycerol (DAG), and inositol triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>).</para>

<para id="fs-id1164965573773">Tyrosine kinase receptors are pairs of proteins that span the plasma membrane.  On the extracellular side of the membrane, one or more sites are present that bind to signaling ligands such as insulin or growth factors.  On the intracellular side, the ends of peptide chains on each protein phosphorylate the other member of the pair, providing active docking sites that initiate cellular responses.  The signal is switched off by dissociation of the ligand.  For each ligand-receptor system, the equilibrium constant, k, controls the distribution of receptor-bound and unbound ligands.  In systems with large values of k, a site is likely to be occupied, even at low concentrations of ligand.  When k is small, the likelihood of binding is low, even when the concentration of ligand is high.  To initiate a new stimulus response cycle for the receptor, the ligand must dissociate.  Larger values of k mean that the receptor is more likely to be occupied and thus unavailable to bind another ligand.</para>

For hemoglobin, the binding is positively cooperative.  The affinity of oxygen for heme increases as the number of bound oxygen molecules increases.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164964072000">Organisms, including plants, have evolved chemical signaling pathways to direct physiological responses to environmental changes.  Stomata are pores, typically on the underside of leaves that regulate CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O exchange between plants and the external environment.  This interaction controls photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate.  The opening and closing of stomata are controlled by specialized guard cells that surround the stomatal pore.  The osmotic state within the guard cells determines their turgor; when the guard cells are flaccid, stomata close.  Turgor in the guard cells is regulated by the active transport of several ions, including K<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>, across the plasma membrane.  Several environmental factors can cause stomatal closing: water deficit, darkness, microbes, ozone, and sulfur dioxide and other pollutants.  Intracellular carbon dioxide concentration and light can trigger stomata to open.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164965157673">The system is regulated by a phytohormone (plant hormone) called abscisic acid (ABA) and the amino acid precursor of the synthesis of a second phytohormone called ethylene (ACC).  The second messengers NO and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the signal response to changes in the concentrations of these hormones activate transcription factors that affect ion transport across guard cell membranes. High CO<sub>2</sub> levels and light also alter phytohormone concentrations.</para>
