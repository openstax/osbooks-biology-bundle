  <para id="fs-idp82403568">Fungi, once considered plant-like organisms, are more closely related to animals than plants. Fungi are not capable of photosynthesis: they are heterotrophic because they use complex organic compounds as sources of energy and carbon. Fungi share a few other traits with animals. Their cell walls are composed of chitin, which is found in the exoskeletons of arthropods. Fungi produce a number of pigments, including melanin, also found in the hair and skin of animals. Like animals, fungi also store carbohydrates as glycogen. However, like bacteria, fungi absorb nutrients across the cell surface and act as decomposers, helping to recycle nutrients by breaking down organic materials to simple molecules.</para><para id="fs-idp82486578">Some fungal organisms multiply only asexually, whereas others undergo both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction with alternation of generations. Most fungi produce a large number of <term>spores</term>, which are haploid cells that can undergo mitosis to form multicellular, haploid individuals.</para>
  <para id="fs-idm43277360">Fungi often interact with other organisms, forming beneficial or mutualistic associations. For example, most terrestrial plants form symbiotic relationships with fungi. The roots of the plant connect with the underground parts of the fungus, which form <term>mycorrhizae</term>. Through mycorrhizae, the fungus and plant exchange nutrients and water, greatly aiding the survival of both species. Alternatively, lichens are an association between a fungus and its photosynthetic partner (usually an alga).</para>
  <para id="fs-idm43267307">Fungi also cause serious infections in plants and animals. For example, Dutch elm disease, which is caused by the fungus<emphasis effect="italics"> Ophiostoma ulmi</emphasis>, is a particularly devastating type of fungal infestation that destroys many native species of elm (<emphasis effect="italics">Ulmus</emphasis> sp.) by infecting the tree’s vascular system. The elm bark beetle acts as a vector, transmitting the disease from tree to tree. Accidentally introduced in the 1900s, the fungus decimated elm trees across the continent. Many European and Asiatic elms are less susceptible to Dutch elm disease than American elms.</para><para id="fs-idp2071136">In humans, fungal infections are generally considered challenging to treat. Unlike bacteria, fungi do not respond to traditional antibiotic therapy, since they are eukaryotes. Fungal infections may prove deadly for individuals with compromised immune systems.</para>
  <para id="fs-idp114547232">Fungi have many commercial applications. The food industry uses yeasts in baking, brewing, and cheese and wine making. Many industrial compounds are byproducts of fungal fermentation. Fungi are the source of many commercial enzymes and antibiotics.</para>
<para id="fs-idp34354240">Although humans have used yeasts and mushrooms since prehistoric times, until recently, the biology of fungi was poorly understood. In fact, up until the mid-20th century, many scientists classified fungi as plants! Fungi, like plants, are mostly sessile and seemingly rooted in place. They possess a stem-like structure similar to plants, as well as having a root-like fungal mycelium in the soil. In addition, their mode of nutrition was poorly understood. Progress in the field of fungal biology was the result of <term>mycology</term>: the scientific study of fungi. Based on fossil evidence, fungi have been found in the Devonian era, about 410 million years ago. However, new findings might place the appearance of the first fungi during the Neoproterozoic era, about 900 million years ago. Molecular biology analysis of the fungal genome demonstrates that fungi are more closely related to animals than plants. Under some current systematic phylogenies, they continue to be a monophyletic group of organisms.</para><note id="fs-idm32494528" class="career"><label/><title>Career Connection</title>

<para id="fs-idm43547024"><title>Mycologist</title><term>Mycologists</term> are biologists who study fungi. Historically, mycology was a branch of microbiology, and many mycologists start their careers with a degree in microbiology. To become a mycologist, a bachelor's degree in a biological science (preferably majoring in microbiology) and a master's degree in mycology are minimally necessary. Mycologists can specialize in taxonomy and fungal genomics, molecular and cellular biology, plant pathology, biotechnology, or biochemistry. Some medical microbiologists concentrate on the study of infectious diseases caused by fungi, called mycoses. Mycologists collaborate with zoologists and plant pathologists to identify and control difficult fungal infections, such as the devastating chestnut blight, the mysterious decline in frog populations in many areas of the world, or the deadly epidemic called white nose syndrome, which is decimating bats in the Eastern United States.</para>
<para id="fs-idp89147440">Government agencies hire mycologists as research scientists and technicians to monitor the health of crops, national parks, and national forests. Mycologists are also employed in the private sector by companies that develop chemical and biological control products or new agricultural products, and by companies that provide disease control services. Because of the key role played by fungi in the fermentation of alcohol and the preparation of many important foods, scientists with a good understanding of fungal physiology routinely work in the food technology industry. Oenology, the science of wine making, relies not only on the knowledge of grape varietals and soil composition, but also on a solid understanding of the characteristics of the wild yeasts that thrive in different wine-making regions. It is possible to purchase yeast strains isolated from specific grape-growing regions. The great French chemist and microbiologist, Louis Pasteur, made many of his essential discoveries working on the humble brewer’s yeast, thus discovering the process of <emphasis effect="italics">fermentation</emphasis>.</para>

<title>Cell Structure and Function</title>
<para id="fs-idp69724528">Fungi are eukaryotes, and as such, have a complex cellular organization. As eukaryotes, fungal cells contain a membrane-bound nucleus. The DNA in the nucleus is represented by multiple linear molecules wrapped around histone proteins, as is observed in other eukaryotic cells. A few types of fungi have accessory genomic structures comparable to bacterial plasmids (loops of DNA); however, the horizontal transfer of genetic information that occurs between one bacterium and another rarely occurs in fungi. Fungal cells also contain mitochondria and a complex system of internal membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.</para><para id="fs-idm5758496">Unlike plant cells, fungal cells do not have chloroplasts or chlorophyll. Many fungi display bright colors arising from other cellular pigments, ranging from red to green to black. The poisonous <emphasis effect="italics">Amanita muscaria </emphasis>(fly agaric) is recognizable by its bright red cap with white patches (<link target-id="fig-ch24_01_01" document=""/>). Pigments in fungi are associated with the cell wall and play a protective role against ultraviolet radiation. Some fungal pigments are toxic to humans.</para>

<para id="fs-idp74771648">Like plant cells, fungal cells have a thick cell wall. The rigid layers of fungal cell walls contain complex polysaccharides called <emphasis effect="italics">chitin</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">glucans</emphasis>. Chitin <emphasis effect="bold">(N-acetyl-D-glucosamine)</emphasis>, also found in the exoskeleton of arthropods such as insects, gives structural strength to the cell walls of fungi. The wall provides structural support and protects the cell from desiccation and some predators. Fungi have plasma membranes similar to those of other eukaryotes, except that the structure is stabilized by <emphasis effect="italics">ergosterol</emphasis>: a steroid molecule that replaces the cholesterol found in animal cell membranes. Most members of the kingdom Fungi are nonmotile. However, flagella are produced by the spores and gametes in the primitive Phylum Chytridiomycota.</para><section id="fs-idm39979312">
<title>Growth</title>
<para id="fs-idm22733216">The vegetative body of a fungus is a unicellular or multicellular <emphasis effect="italics">thallus</emphasis>. Unicellular fungi are called yeasts. Multicellular fungi produce threadlike <emphasis effect="italics">hyphae</emphasis> (singular hypha). Dimorphic fungi can change from the unicellular to multicellular state depending on environmental conditions. <emphasis effect="italics">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</emphasis> (baker’s yeast) and <emphasis effect="italics">Candida</emphasis> species (the agents of thrush, a common fungal infection) are examples of unicellular fungi (<link target-id="fig-ch24_01_02" document=""/>).</para>

They display two distinct morphological stages: the vegetative and reproductive. The vegetative stage consists of a tangle of hyphae, whereas the reproductive stage can be more conspicuous. The mass of hyphae is a <term>mycelium</term> (<link target-id="fig-ch24_01_03" document=""/>). It can grow on a surface, in soil or decaying material, in a liquid, or even on living tissue. Although individual hyphae must be observed under a microscope, the mycelium of a fungus can be very large, with some species truly being “the fungus humongous.” The giant <emphasis effect="italics">Armillaria solidipes</emphasis> (honey mushroom) is considered the largest organism on Earth, spreading across more than 2,000 acres of underground soil in eastern Oregon; it is estimated to be at least 2,400 years old.</para>

In most phyla of fungi, tiny holes in the septa allow for the rapid flow of nutrients and small molecules from cell to cell along the hypha. They are described as <emphasis effect="italics">perforated septa</emphasis>. The hyphae in bread molds (which belong to the Phylum Zygomycota) are not separated by septa. Instead, they are formed by large cells containing many nuclei (multinucleate), an arrangement described as <emphasis effect="italics">coenocytic hyphae</emphasis> (<link target-id="fig-ch24_01_04" document=""/>b).</para>

They vary in their oxygen requirement. Most fungi are <term>obligate aerobes</term>, requiring oxygen to survive. Other species, such as members of the Chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle, are <term>obligate anaerobes</term>, in that they only use anaerobic respiration because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them. Yeasts are intermediate, being <term>facultative anaerobes</term>. This means that they grow best in the presence of oxygen using aerobic respiration, but can survive using anaerobic respiration when oxygen is not available. The alcohol produced from yeast fermentation is used in wine and beer production.</para></section>
<section id="fs-idm29406576">
<title>Nutrition</title>
<para id="fs-idp60630640">Like animals, fungi are heterotrophs; they use complex organic compounds as a source of carbon, rather than fix carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as do some bacteria and most plants. In addition, fungi do not fix nitrogen from the atmosphere. Like animals, they must obtain it from their diet. However, unlike most animals, which ingest food and then digest it internally in specialized organs, fungi perform these steps in the reverse order; digestion precedes ingestion. First, <emphasis effect="italics">exoenzymes</emphasis> are transported out of the hyphae, where they process nutrients in the environment. Then, the smaller molecules produced by this <emphasis effect="italics">external digestion</emphasis> are absorbed through the large surface area of the mycelium. As with animal cells, the polysaccharide of storage is <emphasis effect="italics">glycogen</emphasis>, a branched polysaccharide, rather than amylopectin, a less densely branched polysaccharide, and amylose, a linear polysaccharide, as found in plants.</para>
<para id="fs-idp87932768">Fungi are mostly <term>saprobes</term> (saprophyte is an equivalent term): organisms that derive nutrients from decaying organic matter. They obtain their nutrients from dead or decomposing organic material derived mainly from plants. Fungal exoenzymes are able to break down insoluble compounds, such as the cellulose and lignin of dead wood, into readily absorbable glucose molecules. The carbon, nitrogen, and other elements are thus released into the environment. Because of their varied metabolic pathways, fungi fulfill an important ecological role and are being investigated as potential tools in <emphasis effect="italics">bioremediation</emphasis> of chemically damaged ecosystems. For example, some species of fungi can be used to break down diesel oil and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Other species take up heavy metals, such as cadmium and lead.</para>
<para id="fs-idm25626032">Some fungi are parasitic, infecting either plants or animals. Smut and Dutch elm disease affect plants, whereas athlete’s foot and candidiasis (thrush) are medically important fungal infections in humans. In environments poor in nitrogen, some fungi resort to predation of nematodes (small non-segmented roundworms). In fact, species of <emphasis effect="italics">Arthrobotrys</emphasis> fungi have a number of mechanisms to trap nematodes: One mechanism involves constricting rings within the network of hyphae. The rings swell when they touch the nematode, gripping it in a tight hold. The fungus then penetrates the tissue of the worm by extending specialized hyphae called <term>haustoria</term>. Many parasitic fungi possess haustoria, as these structures penetrate the tissues of the host, release digestive enzymes within the host's body, and absorb the digested nutrients.</para></section>

<title>Reproduction</title>
<para id="fs-idp41238384">Fungi reproduce sexually and/or asexually. Some fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually, while other fungi reproduce only asexually (by mitosis).</para><para id="fs-idp75104432">In both sexual and asexual reproduction, fungi produce spores that disperse from the parent organism by either floating on the wind or hitching a ride on an animal. Fungal spores are smaller and lighter than plant seeds. For example, the giant puffball mushroom bursts open and releases trillions of spores in a massive cloud of what looks like finely particulate dust. The huge number of spores released increases the likelihood of landing in an environment that will support growth (<link target-id="fig-ch24_01_05" document=""/>).</para>

<title>Asexual Reproduction</title>
<para id="fs-idp69535120">Fungi reproduce asexually by <emphasis effect="italics">fragmentation, budding</emphasis>, or <emphasis effect="italics">producing spores</emphasis>. Fragments of hyphae can grow new colonies. Somatic cells in yeast form buds. During budding (an expanded type of cytokinesis), a bulge forms on the side of the cell, the nucleus divides mitotically, and the bud ultimately detaches itself from the mother cell (<link target-id="fig-ch24_01_06" document=""/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm1449008">The most common mode of asexual reproduction is through the formation of asexual spores, which are produced by a single individual <emphasis effect="italics">thallus</emphasis> (through mitosis) and are genetically identical to the parent thallus (<link target-id="fig-ch24_01_07" document=""/>). Spores allow fungi to expand their distribution and colonize new environments.

This is called the heterokaryotic stage. The dikaryotic cells (cells with two more more nuclei) undergo karyogamy, a process in which the nuclei fuse to form a diploid (2n) zygote. The zygote undergoes meiosis to form haploid (1n) spores. Germination of the spores results in the formation of a multicellular mycelium.">

<title>Sexual Reproduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm38077088">Sexual reproduction introduces genetic variation into a population of fungi.

Finally, meiosis takes place in the gametangia (singular, gametangium) organs, in which gametes of different mating types are generated.

<title>Section Summary</title>
<para id="fs-idp28404224">Fungi are eukaryotic organisms that appeared on land more than 450 million years ago, but clearly have an evolutionary history far greater. They are heterotrophs and contain neither photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll, nor organelles such as chloroplasts. Fungi that feed on decaying and dead matter are termed saprobes. Fungi are important decomposers that release essential elements into the environment. External enzymes called exoenzymes digest nutrients that are absorbed by the body of the fungus, which is called a thallus. A thick cell wall made of chitin surrounds the cell. Fungi can be unicellular as yeasts, or develop a network of filaments called a mycelium, which is often described as mold. Most species multiply by asexual and sexual reproductive cycles. In one group of fungi, no sexual cycle has been identified. Sexual reproduction involves plasmogamy (the fusion of the cytoplasm), followed by karyogamy (the fusion of nuclei). Following these processes, meiosis generates haploid spores.</para></section>

<para id="eip-idm15411472">Animals have no cell walls; fungi have cell walls containing chitin; plants have cell walls containing cellulose. Chloroplasts are absent in both animals and fungi but are present in plants. Animal plasma membranes are stabilized with cholesterol, while fungi plasma membranes are stabilized with ergosterol, and plant plasma membranes are stabilized with phytosterols. Animals obtain N and C from food sources via internal digestion. Fungi obtain N and C from food sources via external digestion. Plants obtain organic N from the environment or through symbiotic N-fixing bacteria; they obtain C from photosynthesis. Animals and fungi store polysaccharides as glycogen, while plants store them as starch.</para>

<para id="eip-265">
Why is the large surface area of the mycelium essential for nutrient acquisition by fungi?
</para>
</problem>
<solution id="eip-756"><label/>
<para id="eip-213">
Fungi break down decaying matter in their environment to serve as their food source. Since the digestion occurs externally, the large mycelium can secrete exoenzymes over a large area. The fungi must be able to absorb the small molecules released by digestion, so having a large surface area increases the amount of digested molecules that are captured by the fungi.
