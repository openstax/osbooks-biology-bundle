<para id="fs-id2017945">The <term id="term-00001">cell cycle</term> is an ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produces two new daughter cells. Cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages of growth, DNA replication, and division that produce two genetically identical cells. The cell cycle has two major phases: interphase and the mitotic phase (<link target-id="fig-ch06_02_01"/>). During <term id="term-00002">interphase</term>, the cell grows and DNA is replicated. During the <term id="term-00003">mitotic</term> <term id="term-00004">phase</term>, the replicated DNA and cytoplasmic contents are separated and the cell divides.

<caption>A cell moves through a series of phases in an orderly manner. During interphase, G<sub>1</sub> involves cell growth and protein synthesis, the S phase involves DNA replication and the replication of the centrosome, and G<sub>2</sub> involves further growth and protein synthesis. The mitotic phase follows interphase. Mitosis is nuclear division during which duplicated chromosomes are segregated and distributed into daughter nuclei. Usually the cell will divide after mitosis in a process called cytokinesis in which the cytoplasm is divided and two daughter cells are formed.</caption></figure><section id="fs-id1889794">
<title>Interphase</title>
<para id="fs-id2890845">During interphase, the cell undergoes normal processes while also preparing for cell division. For a cell to move from interphase to the mitotic phase, many internal and external conditions must be met. The three stages of interphase are called G<sub>1</sub>, S, and G<sub>2</sub>.</para>

<section id="fs-id2025386">
<title>G<sub>1</sub> Phase</title>
<para id="fs-id2746045">The first stage of interphase is called the <term id="term-00005">G<sub>1</sub> phase</term>, or first gap, because little change is visible. However, during the G<sub>1</sub> stage, the cell is quite active at the biochemical level. The cell is accumulating the building blocks of chromosomal DNA and the associated proteins, as well as accumulating enough energy reserves to complete the task of replicating each chromosome in the nucleus.</para>

<section id="fs-id2937997">
<title>S Phase</title>
<para id="fs-id1867112">Throughout interphase, nuclear DNA remains in a semi-condensed chromatin configuration. In the <term id="term-00006">S phase</term> (synthesis phase), DNA replication results in the formation of two identical copies of each chromosome—sister chromatids—that are firmly attached at the centromere region. At this stage, each chromosome is made of two sister chromatids and is a duplicated chromosome. The centrosome is duplicated during the S phase. The two centrosomes will give rise to the <term id="term-00007">mitotic</term> <term id="term-00008">spindle</term>, the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during mitosis. The centrosome consists of a pair of rod-like <term id="term-00009">centrioles</term> at right angles to each other. Centrioles help organize cell division. Centrioles are not present in the centrosomes of many eukaryotic species, such as plants and most fungi.</para>

<title>G<sub>2</sub> Phase</title>
<para id="fs-id1851098">In the <term id="term-00010">G<sub>2</sub> phase</term>, or second gap, the cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes the proteins necessary for chromosome manipulation. Some cell organelles are duplicated, and the cytoskeleton is dismantled to provide resources for the mitotic spindle. There may be additional cell growth during G<sub>2</sub>. The final preparations for the mitotic phase must be completed before the cell is able to enter the first stage of mitosis.</para>

<title>The Mitotic Phase</title>
<para id="fs-id2310725">To make two daughter cells, the contents of the nucleus and the cytoplasm must be divided. The mitotic phase is a multistep process during which the duplicated chromosomes are aligned, separated, and moved to opposite poles of the cell, and then the cell is divided into two new identical daughter cells. The first portion of the mitotic phase, <term id="term-00011">mitosis</term>, is composed of five stages, which accomplish nuclear division. The second portion of the mitotic phase, called cytokinesis, is the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells.</para>

During metaphase, the centrosomes are at opposite poles of the cell. Chromosomes line up at the metaphase plate and each sister chromatid is attached to spindle fibers originating from the opposite poles. During anaphase, the centromeres split in two. The sister chromatids, which are now called chromosomes, move toward opposite poles of the cell. Certain spindle fibers lengthen, elongating the cell. During telophase, the chromosomes arrive at the opposite poles and begin to decondense. The nuclear envelope re-forms. During cytokinesis in animals, a cleavage furrow separates the two daughter cells. In plants, a cell plate—the precursor to a new cell wall—separates the two daughter cells.">

</note><para id="fs-id2333055">During <term id="term-00012">prophase</term>, the “first phase,” several events must occur to provide access to the chromosomes in the nucleus. The nuclear envelope starts to break into small vesicles, and the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum fragment and disperse to the periphery of the cell. The nucleolus disappears. The centrosomes begin to move to opposite poles of the cell. The microtubules that form the basis of the mitotic spindle extend between the centrosomes, pushing them farther apart as the microtubule fibers lengthen. The sister chromatids begin to coil more tightly and become visible under a light microscope.</para>
<para id="fs-id2720579">During <term id="term-00013">prometaphase</term>, many processes that were begun in prophase continue to advance and culminate in the formation of a connection between the chromosomes and cytoskeleton. The remnants of the nuclear envelope disappear. The mitotic spindle continues to develop as more microtubules assemble and stretch across the length of the former nuclear area. Chromosomes become more condensed and visually discrete. Each sister chromatid attaches to spindle microtubules at the centromere via a protein complex called the <term id="term-00014">kinetochore</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id2229627">During <term id="term-00015">metaphase</term>, all of the chromosomes are aligned in a plane called the <term id="term-00016">metaphase plate</term>, or the equatorial plane, midway between the two poles of the cell.

<title>Cytokinesis</title>
<para id="fs-id2114336"><term id="term-00019">Cytokinesis</term> is the second part of the mitotic phase during which cell division is completed by the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells. Although the stages of mitosis are similar for most eukaryotes, the process of cytokinesis is quite different for eukaryotes that have cell walls, such as plant cells.</para>
<para id="fs-id3241385">In cells such as animal cells that lack cell walls, cytokinesis begins following the onset of anaphase. A contractile ring composed of actin filaments forms just inside the plasma membrane at the former metaphase plate. The actin filaments pull the equator of the cell inward, forming a fissure. This fissure, or “crack,” is called the <term id="term-00020">cleavage furrow</term>. The furrow deepens as the actin ring contracts, and eventually the membrane and cell are cleaved in two (<link target-id="fig-ch06_02_03"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id2000713">In plant cells, a cleavage furrow is not possible because of the rigid cell walls surrounding the plasma membrane. A new cell wall must form between the daughter cells. During interphase, the Golgi apparatus accumulates enzymes, structural proteins, and glucose molecules prior to breaking up into vesicles and dispersing throughout the dividing cell. During telophase, these Golgi vesicles move on microtubules to collect at the metaphase plate. There, the vesicles fuse from the center toward the cell walls; this structure is called a <term id="term-00021">cell plate</term>. As more vesicles fuse, the cell plate enlarges until it merges with the cell wall at the periphery of the cell. Enzymes use the glucose that has accumulated between the membrane layers to build a new cell wall of cellulose. The Golgi membranes become the plasma membrane on either side of the new cell wall (<link target-id="fig-ch06_02_03"/>).</para>

<title> Control of the Cell Cycle</title>
<para id="fs-id1950986">The length of the cell cycle is highly variable even within the cells of an individual organism. In humans, the frequency of cell turnover ranges from a few hours in early embryonic development to an average of two to five days for epithelial cells, or to an entire human lifetime spent in G<sub>0</sub> by specialized cells such as cortical neurons or cardiac muscle cells. There is also variation in the time that a cell spends in each phase of the cell cycle. When fast-dividing mammalian cells are grown in culture (outside the body under optimal growing conditions), the length of the cycle is approximately 24 hours. In rapidly dividing human cells with a 24-hour cell cycle, the G<sub>1</sub> phase lasts approximately 11 hours. The timing of events in the cell cycle is controlled by mechanisms that are both internal and external to the cell.</para>
