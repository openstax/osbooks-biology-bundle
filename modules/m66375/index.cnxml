<para id="fs-id2074680"><term id="term-00001">Active transport</term> mechanisms require the cell’s energy, usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). If a substance must move into the cell against its concentration gradient—that is, if the substance's concentration inside the cell is greater than its concentration in the extracellular fluid (and vice versa)—the cell must use energy to move the substance. Some active transport mechanisms move small-molecular weight materials, such as ions, through the membrane. Other mechanisms transport much larger molecules.</para>

<title>Electrochemical Gradient</title>
<para id="fs-id2004550">We have discussed simple concentration gradients—a substance's differential concentrations across a space or a membrane—but in living systems, gradients are more complex. Because ions move into and out of cells and because cells contain proteins that do not move across the membrane and are mostly negatively charged, there is also an electrical gradient, a difference of charge, across the plasma membrane. The interior of living cells is electrically negative with respect to the extracellular fluid in which they are bathed, and at the same time, cells have higher concentrations of potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) and lower concentrations of sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) than the extracellular fluid. Thus in a living cell, the concentration gradient of Na<sup>+</sup> tends to drive it into the cell, and its electrical gradient (a positive ion) also drives it inward to the negatively charged interior. However, the situation is more complex for other elements such as potassium. The electrical gradient of K<sup>+</sup>, a positive ion, also drives it into the cell, but the concentration gradient of K<sup>+</sup> drives K<sup>+</sup> <emphasis effect="italics">out</emphasis> of the cell (<link target-id="fig-ch05_03_01"/>). We call the combined concentration gradient and electrical charge that affects an ion its <term id="term-00002">electrochemical gradient</term>.</para>

<caption>Electrochemical gradients arise from the combined effects of concentration gradients and electrical gradients. Na<sup>+</sup> ions are at higher concentration outside the cell, and K<sup>+</sup> ions are at  higher concentration inside of the cell, and yet the inside of the cell has negative net charge compared to the other side of the membrane. This is due to the presence of K<sup>+</sup> binding proteins and other negatively charged molecules. The difference in electrical charges attracts the positively charged Na ions toward the inside of the cell, the electrical gradient, while the K ions tend to flow through K channels toward the outside of the cell due to the concentration difference, the concentration gradient.

<title>Moving Against a Gradient</title>
<para id="fs-id1594022">To move substances against a concentration or electrochemical gradient, the cell must use energy. This energy comes from ATP generated through the cell’s metabolism. Active transport mechanisms, or <term id="term-00003">pumps</term>, work against electrochemical gradients. Small substances constantly pass through plasma membranes. Active transport maintains concentrations of ions and other substances that living cells require in the face of these passive movements. A cell may spend much of its metabolic energy supply maintaining these processes. (A red blood cell uses most of its metabolic energy to maintain the imbalance between exterior and interior sodium and potassium levels that the cell requires.) Because active transport mechanisms depend on a cell’s metabolism for energy, they are sensitive to many metabolic poisons that interfere with the ATP supply.</para>

<title>Carrier Proteins for Active Transport</title>
<para id="fs-id1778201">An important membrane adaptation for active transport is the presence of specific carrier proteins or pumps to facilitate movement: there are three protein types or <term id="term-00006">transporters</term> (<link target-id="fig-ch05_03_02"/>). A <term id="term-00007">uniporter</term> carries one specific ion or molecule. A <term id="term-00008">symporter</term> carries two different ions or molecules, both in the same direction. An <term id="term-00009">antiporter</term> also carries two different ions or molecules, but in different directions. All of these transporters can also transport small, uncharged organic molecules like glucose. These three types of carrier proteins are also in facilitated diffusion, but they do not require ATP to work in that process. Some examples of pumps for active transport are Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase, which carries sodium and potassium ions, and H<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase, which carries hydrogen and potassium ions. Both of these are antiporter carrier proteins. Two other carrier proteins are Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase and H<sup>+</sup> ATPase, which carry only calcium and only hydrogen ions, respectively. Both are pumps.</para>

<caption>The sodium-potassium pump is an example of primary active transport that moves ions, sodium and potassium ions in this instance, across a
membrane against their concentration gradients. The energy is provided by the hydrolysis of ATP. Three sodium ions are moved out of the cell for every 2
potassium ions that are brought into the cell. This creates an electrochemical gradient that is crucial for living cells. Credit: Rao, A., Ryan, K. and Fletcher,

The sodium-potassium pump moves K<sup>+</sup> into the cell while moving Na<sup>+</sup> out at the same time, at a ratio of three Na<sup>+</sup> for every two K<sup>+</sup> ions moved in. The Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase exists in two forms, depending on its orientation to the cell's interior or exterior and its affinity for either sodium or potassium ions. The process consists of the following six steps.</para>
<list id="fs-id1358447" list-type="enumerated">
<item>With the enzyme oriented towards the cell's interior, the carrier has a high affinity for sodium ions. Three ions bind to the protein.</item>
<item>The protein carrier hydrolyzes ATP and a low-energy phosphate group attaches to it.</item>
<item>As a result, the carrier changes shape and reorients itself towards the membrane's exterior. The protein’s affinity for sodium decreases and the three sodium ions leave the carrier.</item>
<item>The shape change increases the carrier’s affinity for potassium ions, and two such ions attach to the protein. Subsequently, the low-energy phosphate group detaches from the carrier.</item>
<item>With the phosphate group removed and potassium ions attached, the carrier protein repositions itself towards the cell's interior.</item>
<item>The carrier protein, in its new configuration, has a decreased affinity for potassium, and the two ions moves into the cytoplasm. The protein now has a higher affinity for sodium ions, and the process starts again.</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-id2019240">Several things have happened as a result of this process. At this point, there are more sodium ions outside the cell than inside and more potassium ions inside than out. For every three sodium ions that move out, two potassium ions move in. This results in the interior being slightly more negative relative to the exterior. This difference in charge is important in creating the conditions necessary for the secondary process. The sodium-potassium pump is, therefore, an <term id="term-00010">electrogenic pump</term> (a pump that creates a charge imbalance), creating an electrical imbalance across the membrane and contributing to the membrane potential.</para>

<title>Secondary Active Transport (Co-transport)</title>
<para id="fs-id1472126">Secondary active transport uses the kinetic energy of the sodium ions to bring other compounds, against their concentration gradient into the cell. As sodium ion concentrations build outside of the plasma membrane because of the primary active transport process, this creates an electrochemical gradient. If a channel protein exists and is open, the sodium ions will move down its concentration gradient across the membrane. This movement transports other substances that must be attached to the same transport protein in order for the sodium ions to move across the membrane (<link target-id="fig-ch05_03_04"/>). Many amino acids, as well as glucose, enter a cell this way. This secondary process also stores high-energy hydrogen ions in the mitochondria of plant and animal cells in order to produce ATP. The potential energy that accumulates in the stored hydrogen ions translates into kinetic energy as the ions surge through the channel protein ATP synthase, and that energy then converts ADP into ATP.</para>

There is also a high concentration of amino acids outside the cell, and a low concentration inside. A sodium-amino acid co-transporter simultaneously transports sodium and the amino acid into the cell. Text within the image reads as follows: Primary Active Transport: the sodium potassium pump moves sodium ions using the energy of ATP hydrolysis to establish a concentration of sodium ions.

<title>Section Summary</title>
<para id="fs-id1396184">The combined gradient that affects an ion includes its concentration gradient and its electrical gradient. A positive ion, for example, might diffuse into a new area, down its concentration gradient, but if it is diffusing into an area of net positive charge, its electrical gradient hampers its diffusion. When dealing with ions in aqueous solutions, one must consider electrochemical and concentration gradient combinations, rather than just the concentration gradient alone. Living cells need certain substances that exist inside the cell in concentrations greater than they exist in the extracellular space. Moving substances up their electrochemical gradients requires energy from the cell. Active transport uses energy stored in ATP to fuel this transport. Active transport of small molecular-sized materials uses integral proteins in the cell membrane to move the materials. These proteins are analogous to pumps. Some pumps, which carry out primary active transport, couple directly with ATP to drive their action. In co-transport (or secondary active transport), energy from primary transport can move another substance into the cell and up its concentration gradient.</para>

<para id="fs-idm200102082">Intestinal epithelial cells use active transport to fulfill their specific role as the cells that transfer glucose from the digested food to the bloodstream. Intestinal cells are exposed to an environment with fluctuating glucose levels. Immediately after eating, glucose in the gut lumen will be high, and could accumulate in intestinal cells by diffusion. However, when the gut lumen is empty, glucose levels are higher in the intestinal cells. If glucose moved by facilitated diffusion, this would cause glucose to flow back out of the intestinal cells and into the gut. Active transport proteins ensure that glucose moves into the intestinal cells, and cannot move back into the gut. It also ensures that glucose transport continues to occur even if high levels of glucose are already present in the intestinal cells.
