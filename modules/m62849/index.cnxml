<para id="fs-id1167063419799">Post-transcriptional regulation can occur at any stage after transcription. One important post-transcriptional mechanism is RNA splicing. After RNA is transcribed, it is often modified to create a mature RNA that is ready to be translated. As we studied in previous chapters, processing messenger RNA involves the removal of introns that do not code for protein. Spliceosomes remove the introns and ligate the exons together, often in different sequences than their original order on the newly transcribed (immature) messenger RNA. A GTP cap is added to the 5’-end and a poly-A tail is added to the 3’-end. This mature messenger RNA then leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. Once in the cytoplasm, the length of time the messenger RNA resides there before being degraded—a characteristic lifespan or “shelf-life” of the molecule called RNA stability—can be altered to control the amount of protein that is synthesized. RNA stability is controlled by several factors, including microRNAs (miRNA or RNAi, RNA interference); miRNAs always decrease stability and promote decay of messenger RNA.</para>

<para id="fs-id2098364">RNA is transcribed, but must be processed into a mature form before translation can begin. This processing after an RNA molecule has been transcribed, but before it is translated into a protein, is called post-transcriptional modification. As with the epigenetic and transcriptional stages of processing, this post-transcriptional step can also be regulated to control gene expression in the cell. If the RNA is not processed, shuttled, or translated, then no protein will be synthesized.</para>

The regions of RNA that code for protein are called exons (<link target-id="fig-ch16_05_01"/>).

    <para id="fs-id1418200">In the 1970s, genes were first observed that exhibited alternative RNA splicing. Alternative RNA splicing is a mechanism that allows different protein products to be produced from one gene when different combinations of introns, and sometimes exons, are removed from the transcript (<link target-id="fig-ch16_05_02"/>). This alternative splicing can be haphazard, but more often it is controlled and acts as a mechanism of gene regulation, with the frequency of different splicing alternatives controlled by the cell as a way to control the production of different protein products in different cells or at different stages of development. Alternative splicing is now understood to be a common mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes; according to one estimate, 70 percent of genes in humans are expressed as multiple proteins through alternative splicing.</para>

When exon skipping occurs, an exon is spliced out in one mature mRNA product and retained in another. When mutually exclusive exons are present in the pre-mRNA, only one is retained in the mature mRNA. When an alternative 5’ donor site is present, the location of the 5’ splice site is variable. When an alternative 3’ acceptor site is present, the location of the 3’ splice site is variable. Intron retention results in an intron being retained in one mature mRNA and spliced out in another.">

<title>Control of RNA Stability</title>
<para id="fs-id1703747">Before the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is given two protective "caps" that prevent the end of the strand from degrading during its journey. The <term id="term-00001">5' cap</term>, which is placed on the 5' end of the mRNA, is usually composed of a methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule (GTP). The  <term id="term-00002">poly-A tail</term>, which is attached to the 3' end, is usually composed of a series of adenine nucleotides. Once the RNA is transported to the cytoplasm, the length of time that the RNA resides there can be controlled. Each RNA molecule has a defined lifespan and decays at a specific rate. This rate of decay can influence how much protein is in the cell. If the decay rate is increased, the RNA will not exist in the cytoplasm as long, shortening the time for translation to occur. Conversely, if the rate of decay is decreased, the RNA molecule will reside in the cytoplasm longer and more protein can be translated. This rate of decay is referred to as the RNA stability. If the RNA is stable, it will be detected for longer periods of time in the cytoplasm.</para><para id="fs-id2167834">Binding of proteins to the RNA can influence its stability. Proteins, called <term id="term-00003">RNA-binding proteins</term>, or RBPs, can bind to the regions of the RNA just upstream or downstream of the protein-coding region. These regions in the RNA that are not translated into protein are called the <term id="term-00004">untranslated regions</term>, or UTRs. They are not introns (those have been removed in the nucleus). Rather, these are regions that regulate mRNA localization, stability, and protein translation. The region just before the protein-coding region is called the <term id="term-00005">5' UTR</term>, whereas the region after the coding region is called the <term id="term-00006">3' UTR</term> (<link target-id="fig-ch16_05_03"/>). The binding of RBPs to these regions can increase or decrease the stability of an RNA molecule, depending on the specific RBP that binds.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-id2572217">Post-transcriptional control can occur at any stage after transcription, including RNA splicing, nuclear shuttling, and RNA stability. Once RNA is transcribed, it must be processed to create a mature RNA that is ready to be translated. This involves the removal of introns that do not code for protein. Spliceosomes bind to the signals that mark the exon/intron border to remove the introns and ligate the exons together. Once this occurs, the RNA is mature and can be translated. RNA is created and spliced in the nucleus, but needs to be transported to the cytoplasm to be translated. RNA is transported to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex. Once the RNA is in the cytoplasm, the length of time it resides there before being degraded, called RNA stability, can also be altered to control the overall amount of protein that is synthesized. The RNA stability can be increased, leading to longer residency time in the cytoplasm, or decreased, leading to shortened time and less protein synthesis. RNA stability is controlled by RNA-binding proteins (RPBs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). These RPBs and miRNAs bind to the 5' UTR or the 3' UTR of the RNA to increase or decrease RNA stability. Depending on the RBP, the stability can be increased or decreased significantly; however, miRNAs always decrease stability and promote decay.</para></section>
