Often too small to be seen without a microscope, cells come in all sizes and shapes, and their small size allows for a large surface area-to-volume ratio that enables a more efficient exchange of nutrients and wastes with the environment.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065839444">There are three basic types of cells: archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. Both archaea and bacteria are classified as prokaryotes, whereas cells of animals, plants, fungi, and protists are eukaryotes. Archaea are a unique group of organisms and likely evolved in the harsh conditions of early Earth and are still prevalent today in extreme environments, such as hot springs and polar regions. All cells share features that reflect their evolution from a common ancestor; these features are 1) a plasma membrane that separates the cell from its environment; 2) cytoplasm comprising the jelly-like cytosol inside the cell; 3) ribosomes that are important for the synthesis of proteins, and 4) DNA to store and transmit hereditary information.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065826065">Prokaryotes may also have a cell wall that acts as an extra layer of protection against the external environment. The term “prokaryote” means “before nucleus,” and prokaryotes do not have nuclei. Rather, their DNA exists as a single circular chromosome in the central part of the cell called the nucleoid. Some bacterial cells also have circular DNA plasmids that often carry genes for resistance to antibiotics (Chapter 17). Other common prokaryotic cell features include flagella and pili.</para>

<label>Background Information</label>
<para id="fs-id1167065841232">The major structures common to all bacteria are depicted in Figure 4.5. The cell wall contains a complex structural component, the peptidoglycan layer, which has yet to be observed in any eukaryotic cell. This peptidoglycan layer is made of a network of alternating modified complex sugar units, the glycans, joined by peptide cross-bridges. This rigid structure contributes to the shape of bacterial cells and protects them against changes in osmotic pressure in the environment. Antibiotics such as penicillin interfere with the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layers and cause bacterial cells to lyse without affecting the human host.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065024345">Many bacterial cells contain plasmids: small, extrachromosomal rings of double-stranded DNA which can replicate independently of the bacterial chromosome and often carry genes which confer resistance to antibiotics. Bacteria readily transfer plasmids to other bacterial cells by a mechanism called horizontal gene transfer, thereby spreading antibiotic resistance.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167066035792">Cells at the lower end of the size spectrum are limited on just how small they can be. To illustrate, compare a bacterial cell to a bag packed for camping in the wilderness. In order to make the camping trip possible, the bag must contain a minimum amount of supplies and equipment. Here, introduce the concept of prokaryotes, bacteria and archaea. Prokaryotes are the most successful organisms on the planet. They probably appeared first during evolution and occupy every possible environment.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065847278">Surface area-to-volume ratio limits the maximum size of a cell. Nutrients and intermediates enter the cell by diffusion. As the cell increases in size, the volume increase outpaces the surface area increase, and the cell size exceeds the capacity of the surface area to adequately exchange nutrients and waste with the external environment.</para>

<note id="fs-id1167066097328" class="ost-misconception"><label>Misconception Alert</label>
<para id="fs-id1167064892531">“All bacteria cause disease.” This misconception started with the germ theory of disease when it became clear that some of the most feared diseases were caused by microorganisms. In fact, very few microorganisms are actually pathogens. The balance between control of infectious diseases and reasonable sanitary standards is often misunderstood. Excess hygiene is thought to have caused an increase in asthma and other immune system imbalances between a human host and the human microbiome. Ask students if one can be “too clean.” The notion that improved hygiene has led to increases in the prevalence of allergies and asthma is called the “hygiene hypothesis.”</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065721087">Until recently, surface area-to-volume ratio was considered the main factor in determining the limits of cell sizes. New research opened the possibility that other factors such as avoiding predators, cell division mechanics and environment also contribute to size and shape determination. The topic is reviewed in the following article:</para>

Challenge students by asking them why the rapid development of microbiology, the so-called golden age, happened in the nineteenth century, close to 200 years after the discovery of microbial life. One of the main reasons is the germ theory of disease. Once the connection was made between devastating diseases and microbes, the interest in microorganisms soared.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167064541128">Ask students if they can think of ways in which bacteria are beneficial and write them on the board. Include the obvious ones such as probiotics; food and fermentation; and the less obvious ones such as to stimulate the immune system, biofuels, bioremediation (here mention cleaning oil spills), and synthesis of useful products (antibiotics).</para>

<para id="fs-id1056900">The most effective action anyone can take to prevent the spread of contagious illnesses is to wash his or her hands. Why? Because microbes (organisms so tiny that they can only be seen with microscopes) are ubiquitous. They live on doorknobs, money, your hands, and many other surfaces. If someone sneezes into his hand and touches a doorknob, and afterwards you touch that same doorknob, the microbes from the sneezer’s mucus are now on your hands. If you touch your hands to your mouth, nose, or eyes, those microbes can enter your body and could make you sick.</para>

The small size of prokaryotes allows ions and organic molecules that enter them to quickly diffuse to other parts of the cell. Similarly, any wastes produced within a prokaryotic cell can quickly diffuse out. This is not the case in eukaryotic cells, which have developed different structural adaptations to enhance intracellular transport.</para>

<caption>This figure shows relative sizes of microbes on a logarithmic scale (recall that each unit of increase in a logarithmic scale represents a 10-fold increase in the quantity being measured).</caption></figure><para id="fs-id1443691">Small size, in general, is necessary for all cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Let’s examine why that is so. First, we’ll consider the area and volume of a typical cell. Not all cells are spherical in shape, but most tend to approximate a sphere. You may remember from your high school geometry course that the formula for the surface area of a sphere is 4πr<sup>2</sup>, while the formula for its volume is 4πr<sup>3</sup>/3. Thus, as the radius of a cell increases, its surface area increases as the square of its radius, but its volume increases as the cube of its radius (much more rapidly). Therefore, as a cell increases in size, its surface area-to-volume ratio decreases. This same principle would apply if the cell had the shape of a cube (<link target-id="fig-ch04-02-03" document="" class="has-default-text">see this figure</link>). If the cell grows too large, the plasma membrane will not have sufficient surface area to support the rate of diffusion required for the increased volume. In other words, as a cell grows, it becomes less efficient. One way to become more efficient is to divide. Other ways are to increase surface area by foldings of the cell membrane, become flat or thin and elongated, or develop organelles that perform specific tasks. These adaptations lead to the development of more sophisticated cells called eukaryotic cells.</para><para id="fs-id1164189032306">Besides the volume of the cell, the size of the cell is also important for survival. As mentioned before, most cells are approximately spherical in shape. This is because a sphere is the shape with the largest surface area-to-volume ratio. As nutrients diffuse into the cell, a sphere is the shape where nutrients would have to travel the least distance to reach the center. This is important because nutrients and wastes are always exchanged at the periphery of the cell. The shorter the distance these nutrients and wastes have to travel, the faster the exchange of these molecules are.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-id1320930">Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms of the domains Bacteria and Archaea. All prokaryotes have plasma membranes, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and DNA that is not membrane-bound. Most have peptidoglycan cell walls and many have polysaccharide capsules. Prokaryotic cells range in diameter from 0.1 to 5.0 μm.</para><para id="fs-id1320804">As a cell increases in size, its surface area-to-volume ratio decreases. If the cell grows too large, the plasma membrane will not have sufficient surface area to support the rate of diffusion required for the increased volume.</para>
