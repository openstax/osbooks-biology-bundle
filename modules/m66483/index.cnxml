<para id="fs-id1457129">Sexual reproduction requires the union of two specialized cells, called <term id="term-00001">gametes</term>, each of which contains one set of chromosomes. When gametes unite, they form a <emphasis effect="bold">zygote</emphasis>, or fertilized egg that contains two sets of chromosomes. (Note: Cells that contain one set of chromosomes are called <term id="term-00002">haploid</term>; cells containing two sets of chromosomes are called <term id="term-00003">diploid</term>.) If the reproductive cycle is to continue for any sexually reproducing species, then the diploid cell must somehow reduce its number of chromosome sets to produce haploid gametes; otherwise, the number of chromosome sets will double with every future round of fertilization. Therefore, sexual reproduction requires a nuclear division that reduces the number of chromosome sets by half.</para>

In mitosis, both the parent and the daughter nuclei are at the same “ploidy level”—diploid in the case of most multicellular animals. Plants use mitosis to grow as sporophytes, and to grow and produce eggs and sperm as gametophytes; so they use mitosis for both haploid and diploid cells (as well as for all other ploidies). In meiosis, the starting nucleus is always diploid and the daughter nuclei that result are haploid. To achieve this reduction in chromosome number, meiosis consists of one round of chromosome replication followed by two rounds of nuclear division. Because many events that occur during each of the division stages are analogous to the events of mitosis, the same stage names are assigned.

<caption>Overview of Meiosis. The production of gametes is a crucial process for sexually reproducing organisms. Meiosis is the mechanism used to reduce diploid cells to haploid gametes while introducing genetic diversity. Prior to meiosis, chromosomes are replicated in S-phase to ensure proper number of chromosomes in the resulting gametes. During meiosis, two successive rounds of division reduces the number of chromosomes (ploidy) of the cell by half. going from diploid cells to haploid gametes.

<title>Meiosis I</title>
<para id="fs-id1419274">Meiosis is preceded by an interphase consisting of G<sub>1</sub>, S, and G<sub>2</sub> phases, which are nearly identical to the phases preceding mitosis. The G<sub>1</sub> phase (the “first gap phase”) is focused on cell growth. During the S phase—the second phase of interphase—the cell copies or <emphasis effect="italics">replicates</emphasis> the DNA of the chromosomes.

(Note: these chromosome copies are called sister chromatids regardless of whether they are in a female gamete or a male gamete.)</para><section id="fs-id1755317">
<title>Prophase I</title>
<para id="fs-id1340707">Early in prophase I, before the chromosomes can be seen clearly with a microscope, the homologous chromosomes are attached at their tips to the nuclear envelope by proteins. As the nuclear envelope begins to break down, the proteins associated with homologous chromosomes bring the pair closer together.  Recall that in mitosis, homologous chromosomes do not pair together. The <term id="term-00009">synaptonemal complex</term>, a lattice of proteins between the homologous chromosomes, first forms at specific locations and then spreads outward to cover the entire length of the chromosomes. The tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called <emphasis effect="italics">synapsis</emphasis>. In <term id="term-00010">synapsis</term>, the genes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are aligned precisely with each other. The synaptonemal complex supports the exchange of chromosomal segments between homologous nonsister chromatids—a process called <term id="term-00011">crossing over</term>. Crossing over can be observed visually after the exchange as <emphasis effect="italics">chiasmata</emphasis> (singular = chiasma) (<link target-id="fig-ch11-01-01" document=""/>).</para><para id="fs-id1668056">In humans, even though the X and Y sex chromosomes are not completely homologous (that is, most of their genes differ), there is a small region of homology that allows the X and Y chromosomes to pair up during prophase I. A partial synaptonemal complex develops only between the regions of homology.</para>

<caption>Early in prophase I, homologous chromosomes come together to form a synapse. The chromosomes are bound tightly together and in perfect alignment by a protein lattice called a synaptonemal complex and by cohesin proteins at the centromere.</caption></figure><para id="fs-id1220575">Located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called <term id="term-00012">recombination nodules</term>. These assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of <term id="term-00013">crossover</term>—or genetic recombination—between the nonsister chromatids. Near the recombination nodule, the double-stranded DNA of each chromatid is cleaved, the cut ends are modified, and a new connection is made between the nonsister chromatids. As prophase I progresses, the synaptonemal complex begins to break down and the chromosomes begin to condense. When the synaptonemal complex is gone, the homologous chromosomes remain attached to each other at the centromere and at chiasmata. The chiasmata remain until anaphase I. The number of chiasmata varies according to the species and the length of the chromosome. There must be at least one chiasma per chromosome for proper separation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I, but there may be as many as 25. Following crossover, the synaptonemal complex breaks down and the cohesin connection between homologous pairs is removed. At the end of prophase I, the pairs are held together only at the chiasmata (<link target-id="fig-ch11-01-02" document=""/>). These pairs are called <term id="term-00014">tetrads</term> because a total of four sister chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes are now visible.</para><para id="fs-id1687019">The crossover events are the first source of genetic variation in the nuclei produced by meiosis. A single crossover event between homologous nonsister chromatids leads to a reciprocal exchange of equivalent DNA between an egg-derived chromosome and a sperm-derived chromosome. When a recombinant sister chromatid is moved into a gamete cell it will carry a combination of maternal and paternal genes that did not exist before the crossover. Crossover events can occur almost anywhere along the length of the synapsed chromosomes. Different cells undergoing meiosis will therefore produce different recombinant chromatids, with varying combinations of maternal and parental genes. Multiple crossovers in an arm of the chromosome have the same effect, exchanging segments of DNA to produce genetically recombined chromosomes.</para><figure id="fig-ch11-01-02"><media id="fs-id1265035" alt="This illustration shows a pair of homologous chromosomes that are aligned.

<title>Prometaphase I</title>
<para id="fs-id1461481">The key event in prometaphase I is the attachment of the spindle fiber microtubules to the kinetochore proteins at the centromeres. Kinetochore proteins are multiprotein complexes that bind the centromeres of a chromosome to the microtubules of the mitotic spindle. Microtubules grow from microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs). In animal cells, MTOCs are centrosomes located at opposite poles of the cell. The microtubules from each pole move toward the middle of the cell and attach to one of the kinetochores of the two fused homologous chromosomes. Each member of the homologous pair attaches to a microtubule extending from opposite poles of the cell so that in the next phase, the microtubules can pull the homologous pair apart. A spindle fiber that has attached to a kinetochore is called a <emphasis effect="italics">kinetochore microtubule</emphasis>. At the end of prometaphase I, each tetrad is attached to microtubules from both poles, with one homologous chromosome facing each pole. The homologous chromosomes are still held together at the chiasmata. In addition, the nuclear membrane has broken down entirely.</para></section>
<section id="fs-id1195147">
<title>Metaphase I</title>
<para id="fs-id1417670">During metaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are arranged at the <emphasis effect="bold">metaphase plate</emphasis>—roughly in the midline of the cell, with the kinetochores facing opposite poles.  Each homologous pair is oriented randomly at the equator. For example, if the two homologous members of chromosome 1 are labeled <emphasis effect="italics">a</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">b</emphasis>, then the chromosomes could line up a-b or b-a. This is important in determining the genes carried by a gamete, as each will only receive one of the two homologous chromosomes. (Recall that homologous chromosomes are not identical. They contain different versions of the same genes, and after recombination during crossing over, each gamete will have a unique genetic makeup that has never existed before.)</para><para id="fs-id1953443">The randomness in the alignment of recombined chromosomes at the metaphase  plate, coupled with the crossing over events between nonsister chromatids, are responsible for much of the genetic variation in the offspring. To clarify this further, remember that the homologous chromosomes of a sexually reproducing organism are originally inherited as two separate sets, one from each parent. Using humans as an example, one set of 23 chromosomes is present in the egg cell, often called maternal chromosomes because the genetic contributor is often the mother. The other set of 23 chromosomes is contained in the sperm, and the genetic contributor is called a father who provides the paternal chromosomes. Every cell of the multicellular offspring has copies of the original two sets of homologous chromosomes. When the offspring human creates their own gametes through meiosis, the two sets of chromosomes will be rearranged. In prophase I of meiosis, the homologous chromosomes form the tetrads. In metaphase I, these pairs line up at the midway point between the two poles of the cell to form the metaphase plate. Because there is an equal chance that a microtubule fiber will encounter a maternally or paternally inherited chromosome, the arrangement of the tetrads at the metaphase plate is random. Thus, any maternally inherited chromosome may face either pole. Likewise, any paternally inherited chromosome may also face either pole. <emphasis effect="italics">The orientation of each tetrad is independent of the orientation of the other 22 tetrads.</emphasis></para><para id="fs-id1311003">This event—the <emphasis effect="italics">random</emphasis> (or <emphasis effect="italics">independent</emphasis>) assortment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plate—is the second mechanism that introduces variation into the gametes or spores. In each cell that undergoes meiosis, the arrangement of the tetrads is different. The number of variations is dependent on the number of chromosomes making up a set. There are two possibilities for orientation at the metaphase plate; the possible number of alignments therefore equals 2<sup><emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis></sup> in a diploid cell, where <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> is the number of chromosomes per haploid set. Humans have 23 chromosome pairs, which results in over eight million (2<sup>23</sup>) possible genetically-distinct gametes just from the random alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate. This number does not include the variability that was previously produced by crossing over between the nonsister chromatids. Given these two mechanisms, it is highly unlikely that any two haploid cells resulting from meiosis will have the same genetic composition (<link target-id="fig-ch11-01-03" document=""/>).</para><para id="fs-id1021412">To summarize, meiosis I creates genetically diverse gametes in two ways. First, during prophase I, crossover events between the nonsister chromatids of each homologous pair of chromosomes generate recombinant chromatids with new combinations of maternal and paternal genes. Second, the random assortment of tetrads on the metaphase plate produces unique combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes that will make their way into the gametes.</para>

In other organisms, <emphasis effect="bold">cytokinesis</emphasis>—the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells—occurs without reformation of the nuclei.

<title>Comparing Meiosis and Mitosis</title>
<para id="fs-id850564">Mitosis and meiosis are both forms of division of the nucleus in eukaryotic cells. They share some similarities, but also exhibit a number of distinct processes that lead to very different outcomes (<link target-id="fig-ch11-01-06" document=""/>). Mitosis is a single nuclear division that results in two nuclei that are usually partitioned into two new cells. The nuclei resulting from a mitotic division are genetically identical to the original nucleus. They have the same number of sets of chromosomes: one set in the case of haploid cells and two sets in the case of diploid cells. In contrast, meiosis consists of two nuclear divisions resulting in four nuclei that are usually partitioned into four new, genetically distinct cells. The four nuclei produced during meiosis are not genetically identical, and they contain one chromosome set only. This is half the number of chromosome sets of the original cell, which is diploid.</para><para id="fs-id1322104">The main differences between mitosis and meiosis occur in meiosis I, which is a very different nuclear division than mitosis. In meiosis I, the homologous chromosome pairs physically meet and are bound together with the synaptonemal complex. Following this, the chromosomes develop chiasmata and undergo crossover between nonsister chromatids. In the end, the chromosomes line up along the metaphase plate as tetrads—with kinetochore fibers from opposite spindle poles attached to each kinetochore of a homolog to form a tetrad. <emphasis effect="italics">All of these events occur only in meiosis I.</emphasis></para>
<para id="fs-id1165795">When the chiasmata resolve and the tetrad is broken up with the homologous chromosomes moving to one pole or another, the ploidy level—the number of sets of chromosomes in each future nucleus—has been reduced from two to one. For this reason, meiosis I is referred to as a <term id="term-00016">reductional division</term>. There is no such reduction in ploidy level during mitosis.</para><para id="fs-id1418144">Meiosis II is analogous to a mitotic division. In this case, the duplicated chromosomes (only one set of them) line up on the metaphase plate with divided kinetochores attached to kinetochore fibers from opposite poles. During anaphase II, as in mitotic anaphase, the kinetochores divide and one sister chromatid—now referred to as a chromosome—is pulled to one pole while the other sister chromatid is pulled to the other pole. If it were not for the fact that there had been crossover, the two products of each individual meiosis II division would be identical (as in mitosis). Instead, they are different because there has always been at least one crossover per chromosome. Meiosis II is not a reduction division because although there are fewer copies of the genome in the resulting cells, there is still one set of chromosomes, as there was at the end of meiosis I.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-id1135317">Sexual reproduction requires that organisms produce cells that can fuse during fertilization to produce offspring. In most organisms, fertilization occurs between two haploid cells, the larger being called “female” or “egg” and the smaller being called “male” or “sperm." In most animals, meiosis is used to produce haploid eggs and sperm from diploid parent cells so that the fusion of an egg and sperm produces a diploid zygote. As with mitosis, DNA replication occurs prior to meiosis during the S-phase of the cell cycle so that each chromosome becomes a pair of sister chromatids. In meiosis, there are two rounds of nuclear division resulting in four nuclei and usually four daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. The first division separates homologous chromosomes, and the second—like mitosis—separates chromatids into individual chromosomes. Meiosis generates variation in the daughter nuclei during crossover in prophase I as well as during the random alignment of tetrads at metaphase I. The cells that are produced by meiosis are genetically unique.</para><para id="fs-id1664568">Meiosis and mitosis share similar processes, but have distinct outcomes. Mitotic divisions are single nuclear divisions that produce genetically identical daughter nuclei (i.e., each daughter nucleus has the same number of chromosome sets as the original cell). In contrast, meiotic divisions include two nuclear divisions that ultimately produce four genetically different daughter nuclei that have only one chromosome set (instead of the two sets of chromosomes in the parent cell). The main differences between the two nuclear division processes take place during the first division of meiosis: homologous chromosomes pair, crossover, and exchange homologous nonsister chromatid segments. The homologous chromosomes separate into different nuclei during meiosis I, causing a <emphasis effect="italics">reduction of ploidy level in the first division</emphasis>. The second division of meiosis is similar to a mitotic division, except that the daughter cells do not contain identical genomes because of crossover and chromosome recombination in prophase I.</para>

<solution id="fs-id1320890"><label/>
<para id="fs-id1391697">During the meiotic interphase, each chromosome is duplicated. The sister chromatids that are formed during synthesis are held together at the centromere region by cohesin proteins. All chromosomes are attached to the nuclear envelope by their tips. As the cell enters prophase I, the nuclear envelope begins to fragment and the proteins holding homologous chromosomes locate each other. The four sister chromatids align lengthwise, and a protein lattice called the synaptonemal complex is formed between them to bind them together. The synaptonemal complex facilitates crossover between nonsister chromatids, which is observed as chiasmata along the length of the chromosome. As prophase I progresses, the synaptonemal complex breaks down and the sister chromatids become free, except where they are attached by chiasmata. At this stage, the four chromatids are visible in each homologous pairing and are called a tetrad.</para></solution>

<solution id="fs-id1275260"><label/>
<para id="fs-id1465101">Random alignment leads to new combinations of traits. The chromosomes that were originally inherited by the gamete-producing individual came equally from the egg and the sperm. In metaphase I, the duplicated copies of these maternal and paternal homologous chromosomes line up across the center of the cell. The orientation of each tetrad is random. There is an equal chance that the maternally derived chromosomes will be facing either pole. The same is true of the paternally derived chromosomes. The alignment should occur differently in almost every meiosis. As the homologous chromosomes are pulled apart in anaphase I, any combination of maternal and paternal chromosomes will move toward each pole. The gametes formed from these two groups of chromosomes will have a mixture of traits from the individual’s parents. Each gamete is unique.</para></solution>

<para id="fs-id1618352">The chromosomes of the individual cannot cross over during meiosis if the individual cannot make recombination nodules.

<solution id="fs-id1431520"><label/>
<para id="fs-id1617357">Crossing over does not occur during prophase II; it only occurs during prophase I. In prophase II, there are still two copies of each gene, but they are on sister chromatids within a single chromosome (rather than homologous chromosomes as in prophase I). Therefore, any crossover event would still produce two identical chromatids. Because it is advantageous to avoid wasting energy on events that will not increase genetic diversity, crossing over does not occur.</para>
