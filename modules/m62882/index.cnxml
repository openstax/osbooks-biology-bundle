<para id="fs-id1167062461308">Viruses differ from other organisms in their method of replication. Viruses replicate within a living host cell, producing changes in the cell that often result in the death of the infected cell. Thus, viruses are considered intracellular parasites. Viral replication involves several steps: attachment, penetration, replication, assembly, and release. Viruses are host-specific because they only can attach to and infect cells of certain organisms. Cells that a virus may use to replicate are called <emphasis>permissive</emphasis>. The virus attacks the host cell by first attaching to a specific receptor site on the membrane of the host cell. Next, the viral nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA, enters the host cell, either naked, leaving the protein capsid behind, or with the capsid. If the capsid enters the cell, an additional uncoating step is needed. Viral nucleic acid then becomes available for replication and transcription. The last stage of viral replication is the release of the new virions produced by the host that are able to infect other cells. Depending on the type of virus, the replication cycle facilitates the transfer of genetic information through the <emphasis>lytic</emphasis> and <emphasis>lysogenic</emphasis> cycles.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167062571502" class="ost-reading-discard"><emphasis>Bacteriophages</emphasis>, such as T4 are viruses that infect bacterial cells, can enter both the lytic and lysogenic cycles. Animal viruses cause a variety of infections, for example, hepatitis C, herpes, HPV, colds, and flu. Occasionally, viruses can “hide” and remain latent (dormant) in cells such as nerve or liver cells for months, or even years; for example, the varicella-zoster virus that causes chickenpox in children can reactivate in adults to cause the painful condition known as “shingles.” Oncogenic viruses in animals can cause cancer by interfering with the regulation of the host cell cycle. Plant viruses can cause considerable economic damage caused by poor crop quality and quantity globally.</para>

<title>Steps of Virus Infections</title>
<para id="fs-idm96953392">A virus must use cell processes to replicate. The viral replication cycle can produce dramatic biochemical and structural changes in the host cell, which may cause cell damage. These changes, called <emphasis>cytopathic</emphasis> (causing cell damage) effects, can change cell functions or even destroy the cell. Some infected cells, such as those infected by the common cold virus known as rhinovirus, die through <emphasis>lysis</emphasis> (bursting) or apoptosis (programmed cell death), releasing all progeny virions at once. The symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus, which attempts to control and eliminate the virus from the body, and from cell damage caused by the virus. Many animal viruses leave the infected cells of the immune system by a process known as <emphasis>budding</emphasis>, where virions leave the cell individually. During the budding process, the cell does not undergo lysis and is not immediately killed. However, the damage to the cells that the virus infects may make it impossible for the cells to function normally, even though the cells remain alive for a period of time. Most productive viral infections follow similar steps in the virus replication cycle: attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly, and release (<link target-id="fig-ch21_02_01"/>).</para>

<title>Attachment</title>
<para id="fs-idm143481568">A virus attaches to a specific receptor site on the host cell membrane through attachment proteins in the capsid or via glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope. The specificity of this interaction determines the host—and the cells within the host—that can be infected by a particular virus.

Plant and animal viruses can enter through endocytosis, in which the cell membrane surrounds and engulfs the entire virus. Some enveloped viruses enter the cell when the viral envelope fuses directly with the cell membrane. Once inside the cell, the viral capsid is degraded, and the viral nucleic acid is released, which then becomes available for replication and transcription.</para>

<title>Replication and Assembly</title>
<para id="fs-idm16331920">The replication mechanism depends on the viral genome. DNA viruses usually use host cell proteins and enzymes to make additional DNA that is transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then used to direct protein synthesis. RNA viruses usually use the RNA core as a template for synthesis of viral genomic RNA and mRNA. The viral mRNA directs the host cell to synthesize viral enzymes and capsid proteins, and assemble new virions. Of course, there are exceptions to this pattern. If a host cell does not provide the enzymes necessary for viral replication, viral genes supply the information to direct synthesis of the missing proteins. <emphasis>Retroviruses</emphasis> have an RNA genome that must be reverse transcribed into DNA, which then is incorporated into the host cell genome. They are within group VI of the Baltimore classification scheme. To convert RNA into DNA, retroviruses must contain genes that encode the virus-specific enzyme reverse transcriptase that transcribes an RNA template to DNA. Reverse transcription never occurs in uninfected host cells—the needed enzyme reverse transcriptase is only derived from the expression of viral genes within the infected host cells. The fact that some retroviruses produces some of its own enzymes not found in the host has allowed researchers to develop drugs that inhibit these enzymes. These drugs inhibit replication by reducing the activity of the enzyme without affecting the host’s metabolism. This approach has led to the development of a variety of drugs used to treat these viruses and has been effective at reducing the number of infectious virions (copies of viral RNA) in the blood to non-detectable levels in people affected with the virus.</para>

<title>Different Hosts and Their Viruses</title>
<para id="fs-idm73955568">As you’ve learned, viruses are often very specific as to which hosts and which cells within the host they will infect. This feature of a virus makes it specific to one or a few species of life on Earth. On the other hand, so many different types of viruses exist on Earth that nearly every living organism has its own set of viruses that tries to infect its cells. Even the smallest and simplest of cells, prokaryotic bacteria, may be attacked by specific types of viruses.</para>

<para id="fs-idm191701376">Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria (<link target-id="fig-ch21_02_02"/>). When infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions, the infection is said to be <emphasis>productive</emphasis>. If the virions are released by bursting the cell, the virus replicates by means of a lytic cycle (<link target-id="fig-ch21_02_03"/>). An example of a lytic bacteriophage is T4, which infects <emphasis effect="italics">Escherichia coli</emphasis> found in the human intestinal tract. Sometimes, however, a virus can remain within the cell without being released. For example, when a temperate bacteriophage infects a bacterial cell, it replicates by means of a lysogenic cycle (<link target-id="fig-ch21_02_03"/>), and the viral genome is incorporated into the genome of the host cell. When the phage DNA is incorporated into the host cell genome, it is called a <emphasis>prophage</emphasis>. An example of a lysogenic bacteriophage is the λ (lambda) virus, which also infects the <emphasis effect="italics">E</emphasis>. <emphasis effect="italics">coli</emphasis> bacterium. Viruses that infect plant or animal cells may also undergo infections where they are not producing virions for long periods. An example is the animal herpesviruses, including herpes simplex viruses, the cause of herpes in humans. In a process called <emphasis>latency</emphasis>, these viruses can exist in nervous tissue for long periods of time without producing new virions, only to leave latency periodically and cause lesions in the skin where the virus replicates. Even though there are similarities between lysogeny and latency, the term lysogenic cycle is usually reserved to describe bacteriophages. Latency will be described in more detail below.</para>

<title>Animal Viruses</title>
<para id="fs-idm53290352">Animal viruses, unlike the viruses of plants and bacteria, do not have to penetrate a cell wall to gain access to the host cell. Non-enveloped or “naked” animal viruses may enter cells in two different ways. As a protein in the viral capsid binds to its receptor on the host cell, the virus may be taken inside the cell via a vesicle during the normal cell process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. An alternative method of cell penetration used by non-enveloped viruses is for capsid proteins to undergo shape changes after binding to the receptor, creating channels in the host cell membrane. The viral genome is then “injected” into the host cell through these channels in a manner analogous to that used by many bacteriophages. Enveloped viruses also have two ways of entering cells after binding to their receptors: receptor-mediated endocytosis, or <emphasis>fusion</emphasis>. Many enveloped viruses enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis in a fashion similar to some non-enveloped viruses. On the other hand, fusion only occurs with enveloped virions. These viruses, which include HIV among others, use special fusion proteins in their envelopes to cause the envelope to fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell, thus releasing the genome and capsid of the virus into the cell cytoplasm. </para>
<para id="fs-idp63812432">After making their proteins and copying their genomes, animal viruses complete the assembly of new virions and exit the cell Enveloped animal viruses may bud from the cell membrane as they assemble themselves, taking a piece of the cell’s plasma membrane in the process. On the other hand, non-enveloped viral progeny, such as rhinoviruses, accumulate in infected cells until there is a signal for lysis or apoptosis, and all virions are released together.  </para>
<para id="fs-idm68911200">As you will learn in the next module, animal viruses are associated with a variety of human diseases. Some of them follow the classic pattern of <emphasis>acute disease</emphasis>, where symptoms get increasingly worse for a short period followed by the elimination of the virus from the body by the immune system and eventual recovery from the infection. Examples of acute viral diseases are the common cold and influenza. Other viruses cause long-term <emphasis>chronic infections</emphasis>, such as the virus causing hepatitis C, whereas others, like herpes simplex virus, only cause <emphasis>intermittent</emphasis> symptoms. Still other viruses, such as human herpesviruses 6 and 7, which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola, often successfully cause productive infections without causing any symptoms at all in the host, and thus we say these patients have an <emphasis>asymptomatic infection</emphasis>.</para>
<para id="fs-idm53346992">In hepatitis C infections, the virus grows and reproduces in liver cells, causing low levels of liver damage. The damage is so low that infected individuals are often unaware that they are infected, and many infections are detected only by routine blood work on patients with risk factors. On the other hand, since many of the symptoms of viral diseases are caused by immune responses, a lack of symptoms is an indication of a weak immune response to the virus. This allows for the virus to escape elimination by the immune system and persist in individuals for years, all the while producing low levels of progeny virions in what is known as a chronic viral disease.</para>
<para id="fs-idm170248272">As already discussed, herpes simplex virus can remain in a state of latency in nervous tissue for months, even years. As the virus “hides” in the tissue and makes few if any viral proteins, there is nothing for the immune response to act against, and immunity to the virus slowly declines. Under certain conditions, including various types of physical and psychological stress, the latent herpes simplex virus may be reactivated and undergo a lytic replication cycle in the skin, causing the lesions associated with the disease. Once virions are produced in the skin and viral proteins are synthesized, the immune response is again stimulated and resolves the skin lesions in a few days by destroying viruses in the skin. As a result of this type of replicative cycle, appearances of cold sores outbreaks only occur intermittently, even though the viruses remain in the nervous tissue for life. Latent infections are common with other herpesviruses as well, including the varicella-zoster virus that causes chickenpox. After having a chickenpox infection in childhood, the varicella-zoster virus can remain latent for many years and reactivate in adults to cause the painful condition known as “shingles” (<link target-id="fig-ch21_02_04"/><emphasis effect="bold">ab</emphasis>).</para>

These viruses interfere with the normal regulation of the host cell cycle either by either introducing genes that stimulate unregulated cell growth (oncogenes) or by interfering with the expression of genes that inhibit cell growth. Oncogenic viruses can be either DNA or RNA viruses.

<title>Plant Viruses</title>
<para id="fs-idm167641680">Plant viruses, like other viruses, contain a core of either DNA or RNA. You have already learned about one of these, the tobacco mosaic virus. As plant cells have a cell wall to protect their cells, these viruses do not use receptor-mediated endocytosis to enter host cells as is seen with animal viruses. For many plant viruses to be transferred from plant to plant, damage to some of the plants’ cells must occur to allow the virus to enter a new host. This damage is often caused by weather, insects, animals, fire, or human activities like farming or landscaping. Additionally, plant offspring may inherit viral diseases from parent plants. Plant viruses can be transmitted by a variety of vectors, through contact with an infected plant’s sap, by living organisms such as insects and nematodes, and through pollen. When plants viruses are transferred between different plants, this is known as <emphasis>horizontal transmission</emphasis>, and when they are inherited from a parent, this is called <emphasis>vertical transmission</emphasis>.</para><para id="fs-idm37078704">Symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host (<link target-id="tab-ch21_02_01"/>). One common symptom is <emphasis>hyperplasia</emphasis>, the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as <emphasis>galls</emphasis>. Other viruses induce <emphasis>hypoplasia</emphasis>, or decreased cell growth, in the leaves of plants, causing thin, yellow areas to appear. Still other viruses affect the plant by directly killing plant cells, a process known as <emphasis>cell necrosis</emphasis>. Other symptoms of plant viruses include malformed leaves, black streaks on the stems of the plants, altered growth of stems, leaves, or fruits, and ring spots, which are circular or linear areas of discoloration found in a leaf.</para>

</table><para id="fs-idm48110640">Plant viruses can seriously disrupt crop growth and development, significantly affecting our food supply. They are responsible for poor crop quality and quantity globally, and can bring about huge economic losses annually. Others viruses may damage plants used in landscaping. Some viruses that infect agricultural food plants include the name of the plant they infect, such as tomato spotted wilt virus, bean common mosaic virus, and cucumber mosaic virus. In plants used for landscaping, two of the most common viruses are peony ring spot and rose mosaic virus. There are far too many plant viruses to discuss each in detail, but symptoms of bean common mosaic virus result in lowered bean production and stunted, unproductive plants. In the ornamental rose, the rose mosaic disease causes wavy yellow lines and colored splotches on the leaves of the plant.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-idm134569024">Viral replication within a living cell always produces changes in the cell, sometimes resulting in cell death and sometimes slowly killing the infected cells. There are six basic stages in the virus replication cycle: attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly, and release. A viral infection may be productive, resulting in new virions, or nonproductive, which means that the virus remains inside the cell without producing new virions. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria. They have two different modes of replication: the lytic cycle, where the virus replicates and bursts out of the bacteria, and the lysogenic cycle, which involves the incorporation of the viral genome into the bacterial host genome. Animal viruses cause a variety of infections, with some causing chronic symptoms (hepatitis C), some intermittent symptoms (latent viruses such a herpes simplex virus 1), and others that cause very few symptoms, if any (human herpesviruses 6 and 7). Oncogenic viruses in animals have the ability to cause cancer by interfering with the regulation of the host cell cycle. Viruses of plants are responsible for significant economic damage in both agriculture and plants used for ornamentation.</para>

By comparing sequences from the same virus integrated at different points in time, the evolutionary history of the virus can be constructed. The viral genomes are typically found incomplete, in segments, and interrupted by stop codons. In jawed vertebrates, retroviral sequences or sequences that have been derived from them are a significant fraction of the whole genome.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164968687094">A. <emphasis>Explain</emphasis> why retroviral DNA rather than the genomes of single-stranded or double-stranded DNA or single-stranded RNA viruses are found in host DNA.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164968697559">Exaptation occurs when gene expression provides a function that is independent of the selection pressures that have acted on the gene. For example, a pigment that provided selective advantage by reducing damage from solar radiation becomes an element of mating behavior. Feathers that evolved under selection to prevent heat loss become a means of flight.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164966312959">In a study of viral evolution within host genomes of primates, Katzuorakis and Gifford (<emphasis effect="italics">PLOS Genetics</emphasis>, 2010) found that viral genomes within the host were surprisingly stable; with computer simulation, they estimated the probability of such constancy at 1 in 100,000.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164968896677">Distemper is an incurable disease of cats, dogs, and their sister lineages caused by a parvovirus. The virus exploits the hosts transferrin, a membrane-bound protein used for iron transport, to attach to the cell. The phylogeny of the <emphasis effect="italics">Parvoviridae</emphasis> family has been constructed (J. Kaebler, <emphasis effect="italics">PLOS Pathogens</emphasis>, 2012). That study revealed the evolution of both the virus and the host protein through selection to resist infection. About 54 million years ago when the lineage of cats (<emphasis effect="italics">Feliformia</emphasis>) diverged from that of dogs (<emphasis effect="italics">Caniformia</emphasis>), the parvovirus envelope diverged as well, conforming to changes in the hosts transferrin. In 1978, a worldwide disease in dogs due to a parvovirus suddenly appeared.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164968608322">A simple calculation of the rate of spread of a pox virus (virion) led researchers at Imperial College London to a new insight.  Virions communicate with other virions.  The researchers observed that the radius of an approximately circular plaque of infected cells grew to 1.45 mm in just 3 days.  They measured the distance between adjacent cells to be 0.037 mm to obtain the apparent time for the lytic cycle (from infection to lysis).  They compared this time to the actual rate at which new virions are formed: 5 to 6 hours.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164969022223">A. <emphasis>Predict</emphasis> the radius of infection if the infection process involved a sequence of entry, replication, lysis, and infection of an adjacent cell.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164968959353">To account for this discrepancy between observed and predicted growth rates, the researchers examined the viral entry process and discovered that the actin protein on the host cells surface that provided the viral receptor was modified by attachment.  They then found a mutant virus that did not modify the cell surface protein.  The dependence of the growth of plaque radius on time for the wild type and mutant are shown in the graph.</para>
