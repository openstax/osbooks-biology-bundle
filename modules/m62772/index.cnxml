<para id="fs-id1167066050725">Diffusion, osmosis, and active transport are used to transport fairly small molecules across plasma cell membranes. However, sometimes large particles, such as macromolecules, parts of cells, or even unicellular microorganisms, can be engulfed by other cells in a process called phagocytosis or “cell eating.” In this form of endocytosis, the cell membrane surrounds the particle, pinches off, and brings the particle into the cell. For example, when bacteria invade the human body, a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil will remove the invaders by this process. Similarly, in pinocytosis or “cell drinking,” the cell takes in droplets of liquid. In receptor-mediated endocytosis, uptake of substances by the cell is targeted to a single type of substance that binds to a specific receptor protein on the external surface of the cell membrane (e.g., hormones and their target cells) before under going endocytosis. Some human diseases, such as familial hypercholesterolemia, are caused by the failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Exocytosis is the process of exporting material out of the cell; vesicles containing substances fuse with the plasma membrane and the contents are released to the exterior of the cell. The secretion of neurotransmitters at synapses between neurons is an example of exocytosis.</para><para id="fs-id1167065895674" class="ost-reading-discard">Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and learning objectives outlined in Big Idea 2 of the AP<sup>®</sup> Biology Curriculum Framework.

<para id="fs-id1467282">In addition to moving small ions and molecules through the membrane, cells also need to remove and take in larger molecules and particles (see  <link target-id="tab-ch05_04_01"/> for examples).

<title>Endocytosis</title>
<para id="fs-id1416306"><term id="term-00001">Endocytosis</term> is a type of active transport that moves particles, such as large molecules, parts of cells, and even whole cells, into a cell. There are different variations of endocytosis, but all share a common characteristic: The plasma membrane of the cell invaginates, forming a pocket around the target particle. The pocket pinches off, resulting in the particle being contained in a newly created intracellular vesicle formed from the plasma membrane.</para>

<title>Phagocytosis</title>
<para id="fs-id1694237">Phagocytosis (the condition of “cell eating”) is the process by which large particles, such as cells or relatively large particles, are taken in by a cell. For example, when microorganisms invade the human body, a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil will remove the invaders through this process, surrounding and engulfing the microorganism, which is then destroyed by the neutrophil (<link target-id="fig-ch05_04_01"/>).</para>

The coated portion of the membrane then extends from the body of the cell and surrounds the particle, eventually enclosing it. Once the vesicle containing the particle is enclosed within the cell, the clathrin disengages from the membrane and the vesicle merges with a lysosome for the breakdown of the material in the newly formed compartment (endosome). When accessible nutrients from the degradation of the vesicular contents have been extracted, the newly formed endosome merges with the plasma membrane and releases its contents into the extracellular fluid. The endosomal membrane again becomes part of the plasma membrane.</para>

<para id="fs-id2337777">A variation of endocytosis is called <term id="term-00003">pinocytosis</term>. This literally means “cell drinking” and was named at a time when the assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid. In reality, this is a process that takes in molecules, including water, which the cell needs from the extracellular fluid. Pinocytosis results in a much smaller vesicle than does phagocytosis, and the vesicle does not need to merge with a lysosome (<link target-id="fig-ch05_04_02"/>).</para>

This process uses a coating protein, called <term id="term-00005">caveolin</term>, on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, which performs a similar function to clathrin. The cavities in the plasma membrane that form the vacuoles have membrane receptors and lipid rafts in addition to caveolin. The vacuoles or vesicles formed in caveolae (singular caveola) are smaller than those in pinocytosis. Potocytosis is used to bring small molecules into the cell and to transport these molecules through the cell for their release on the other side of the cell, a process called transcytosis. In some cases, the caveolae deliver their cargo to membranous organelles like the ER.</para></section>

If uptake of a compound is dependent on receptor-mediated endocytosis and the process is ineffective, the material will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood. Instead, it will stay in those fluids and increase in concentration. Some human diseases are caused by the failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis. For example, the form of cholesterol termed low-density lipoprotein or LDL (also referred to as “bad” cholesterol) is removed from the blood by receptor-mediated endocytosis. In the human genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDL receptors are defective or missing entirely. People with this condition have life-threatening levels of cholesterol in their blood, because their cells cannot clear LDL particles from their blood.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-id1479267">Active transport methods require the direct use of ATP to fuel the transport. Large particles, such as macromolecules, parts of cells, or whole cells, can be engulfed by other cells in a process called phagocytosis. In phagocytosis, a portion of the membrane invaginates and flows around the particle, eventually pinching off and leaving the particle entirely enclosed by an envelope of plasma membrane. Vesicle contents are broken down by the cell, with the particles either used as food or dispatched. Pinocytosis is a similar process on a smaller scale. The plasma membrane invaginates and pinches off, producing a small envelope of fluid from outside the cell. Pinocytosis imports substances that the cell needs from the extracellular fluid. The cell expels waste in a similar but reverse manner: it pushes a membranous vacuole to the plasma membrane, allowing the vacuole to fuse with the membrane and incorporate itself into the membrane structure, releasing its contents to the exterior.</para>
