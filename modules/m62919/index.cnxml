<para id="fs-id1167062342878">Much information in this chapter is not within the scope of AP<sup>®</sup>. However, the chapter provides us with the opportunity to review concepts we’ve explored previously, including structure and function, macromolecules, energy production, transport of substances across membranes, and enzyme activity. All living organisms require a source of energy and molecules needed to build cells, tissues, and organs. During digestion, food is broken down into smaller molecules for absorption and distribution to all cells of the body. Nutrients are required to carry out cellular processes and maintain homeostasis, and digestion and absorption require the participation of several organs. Different animals have evolved different types of digestive systems specialized to meet their dietary needs. You do not need to memorize details about the different types of animal digestive systems, but you might find it interesting to explore the evolution of the system through a few groups of animals, from intracellular digestion in simple invertebrates to a digestive tract and accessory organs in complex vertebrates. Using a human eating a turkey sandwich as an example, food is ingested through the mouth. The mouth is the location where both mechanical (chewing) and chemical breakdown of food begins via the enzyme amylase, which breaks down carbohydrates into simpler sugars. The food bolus then travels by peristalsis (alternating waves of contraction) down the pharynx and esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, pepsinogen mixes with hydrochloric acid to form pepsin, which begins digesting proteins, such as turkey, into smaller chains of amino acids. Mucus in the stomach protects its lining from damage by acidity, and the tightening of a sphincter prevents stomach contents from regurgitating into the esophagus. Further digestion of the ingredients of the sandwich occurs in the small intestine aided by a variety of enzymes; for example, bile salts and pancreatic amylase dumped into the small intestine from the gallbladder and pancreas, respectively, help emulsify fats. Once the ingredients of the sandwich have been broken down into smaller nutrient molecules, including amino acids, glucose, and fatty acids, they are absorbed from the small intestine into the circulatory and lymphatic systems. The walls of the small intestine contain small, finger-like projections called villi and microvilli that increase surface area for absorption of nutrients by diffusion. The large intestine or colon does not produce digestive enzymes but functions to absorb water, salts, and some vitamins. Any nutrients from the sandwich are stored in the liver, and wastes are eliminated.</para>

<para id="fs-idp163896272">Animals obtain their nutrition by consuming other organisms. Depending on their diet, animals can be classified into the following categories: plant eaters (herbivores), meat eaters (carnivores), and those that eat both plants and animals (omnivores). The nutrients and macromolecules present in food are not immediately accessible to the cells. There are a number of processes that modify food within the animal body to make the nutrients and organic molecules accessible for cellular function. As animals evolved in complexity of form and function, their digestive systems have also evolved to accommodate their various dietary needs.</para>

<title>Invertebrate Digestive Systems</title>
<para id="fs-idm12906864">Animals have evolved different types of digestive systems to aid in the digestion of the various foods they consume. The simplest example is that of a <emphasis>gastrovascular cavity</emphasis> and is found in organisms with only one opening for digestion. Platyhelminthes (flatworms), Ctenophora (comb jellies), and Cnidaria (coral, jelly fish, and sea anemones) use this type of digestion. Gastrovascular cavities, as shown in <link target-id="fig-ch34_01_04" document=""/><emphasis effect="bold">a</emphasis>, are typically a blind tube or cavity with only one opening, the “mouth”, which also serves as an “anus”. Ingested material enters the mouth and passes through a hollow, tubular cavity. Cells within the cavity secrete digestive enzymes that break down the food. The food particles are engulfed by the cells lining the gastrovascular cavity.</para>
<para id="fs-idp41840320">The <emphasis>alimentary canal</emphasis>, shown in <link target-id="fig-ch34_01_04" document=""/><emphasis effect="bold">b</emphasis>, is a more advanced system: it consists of one tube with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other. Earthworms are an example of an animal with an alimentary canal. Once the food is ingested through the mouth, it passes through the esophagus and is stored in an organ called the crop; then it passes into the gizzard where it is churned and digested. From the gizzard, the food passes through the intestine, the nutrients are absorbed, and the waste is eliminated as feces, called castings, through the anus.</para>

The mouth, in the lower middle part of the body, opens into the gastrovascular cavity. Part B shows a nematode, which has a long, tube-like body that is wide at one end and tapers down to a tail at the other. The mouth is in the center of the wide end. It opens into an esophagus, then a pharynx. The pharynx empties into a long intestine, which ends at the anus a short distance before the tail.">

<title>Vertebrate Digestive Systems</title>
<para id="fs-idp209902992">Through evolution, vertebrate digestive systems have adapted to different diets. Some animals have a single stomach, while others have multi-chambered stomachs. Birds have developed a digestive system adapted to eating unmasticated food.</para>

<title>Monogastric: Single-chambered Stomach</title>
<para id="fs-idp69083328">As the word <emphasis>monogastric</emphasis> suggests, this type of digestive system consists of one (“mono”) stomach chamber (“gastric”). Humans and many animals have a monogastric digestive system as illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch34_01_05" document=""/><emphasis effect="bold">ab</emphasis>. The process of digestion begins with the mouth and the intake of food. The teeth play an important role in masticating (chewing) or physically breaking down food into smaller particles. The enzymes present in saliva also begin to chemically break down food. The esophagus is a long tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. Using peristalsis, or wave-like smooth muscle contractions, the muscles of the esophagus push the food towards the stomach. In order to speed up the actions of enzymes in the stomach, the stomach is an extremely acidic environment, with a pH between 1.5 and 2.5. The gastric juices, which include enzymes in the stomach, act on the food particles and continue the process of digestion. Further breakdown of food takes place in the small intestine where enzymes produced by the liver, the small intestine, and the pancreas continue the process of digestion. The nutrients are absorbed into the blood stream across the epithelial cells lining the walls of the small intestines. The waste material travels on to the large intestine where water is absorbed and the drier waste material is compacted into feces; it is stored until it is excreted through the rectum.</para>

Food passes from the stomach to the long, winding small intestine. From there it enters the wide large intestine before passing out the anus. At the junction of the small and large intestine is a pouch called the cecum. The small and large intestines are much longer in rabbits than in humans, and the cecum is much longer as well.">

Rabbits digest their food twice: the first time food passes through the digestive system, it collects in the cecum, and then it passes through the anus as soft feces called cecotrophes. The rabbit re-ingests these cecotrophes to further digest them.</caption></figure></section>

They do not have teeth and so their digestive system, shown in <link target-id="fig-ch34_01_06" document=""/>, must be able to process un-masticated food. Birds have evolved a variety of beak types that reflect the vast variety in their diet, ranging from seeds and insects to fruits and nuts. Because most birds fly, their metabolic rates are high in order to efficiently process food and keep their body weight low. The stomach of birds has two chambers: the <emphasis>proventriculus</emphasis>, where gastric juices are produced to digest the food before it enters the stomach, and the <emphasis>gizzard</emphasis>, where the food is stored, soaked, and mechanically ground. The undigested material forms food pellets that are sometimes regurgitated. Most of the chemical digestion and absorption happens in the intestine and the waste is excreted through the cloaca.</para>

Food passes from the crop to the first of two stomachs, called the proventriculus, which contains digestive juices that break down food. From the proventriculus, the food enters the second stomach, called the gizzard, which grinds food. Some birds swallow stones or grit, which are stored in the gizzard, to aid the grinding process. Birds do not have separate openings to excrete urine and feces. Instead, uric acid from the kidneys is secreted into the large intestine and combined with waste from the digestive process. This waste is excreted through an opening called the cloaca.</caption></figure>

<para id="fs-idp171171200">Birds have a highly efficient, simplified digestive system. Recent fossil evidence has shown that the evolutionary divergence of birds from other land animals was characterized by streamlining and simplifying the digestive system. Unlike many other animals, birds do not have teeth to chew their food. In place of lips, they have sharp pointy beaks. The horny beak, lack of jaws, and the smaller tongue of the birds can be traced back to their dinosaur ancestors. The emergence of these changes seems to coincide with the inclusion of seeds in the bird diet. Seed-eating birds have beaks that are shaped for grabbing seeds and the two-compartment stomach allows for delegation of tasks. Since birds need to remain light in order to fly, their metabolic rates are very high, which means they digest their food very quickly and need to eat often. Contrast this with the ruminants, where the digestion of plant matter takes a very long time.</para>

<title>Ruminants</title>
<para id="fs-idp2702592"><emphasis>Ruminants</emphasis> are mainly herbivores like cows, sheep, and goats, whose entire diet consists of eating large amounts of <emphasis>roughage</emphasis> or fiber. They have evolved digestive systems that help them digest vast amounts of cellulose. An interesting feature of the ruminants’ mouth is that they do not have upper incisor teeth. They use their lower teeth, tongue and lips to tear and chew their food. From the mouth, the food travels to the esophagus and on to the stomach.</para>
<para id="fs-idp23426208">To help digest the large amount of plant material, the stomach of the ruminants is a multi-chambered organ, as illustrated in <link target-id="CNX_AP_Bio_34_01_07" document=""/>. The four compartments of the stomach are called the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. These chambers contain many microbes that break down cellulose and ferment ingested food. The abomasum is the “true” stomach and is the equivalent of the monogastric stomach chamber where gastric juices are secreted. The four-compartment gastric chamber provides larger space and the microbial support necessary to digest plant material in ruminants. The fermentation process produces large amounts of gas in the stomach chamber, which must be eliminated. As in other animals, the small intestine plays an important role in nutrient absorption, and the large intestine helps in the elimination of waste.</para>

After circulating through the omasum the food enters the small intestine, then the large intestine. Waste is excreted through the anus.">

<caption>Ruminant animals, such as goats and cows, have four stomachs. The first two stomachs, the rumen and the reticulum, contain prokaryotes and protists that are able to digest cellulose fiber. The ruminant regurgitates cud from the reticulum, chews it, and swallows it into a third stomach, the omasum, which removes water. The cud then passes onto the fourth stomach, the abomasum, where it is digested by enzymes produced by the ruminant.</caption></figure></section>

<title>Pseudo-ruminants</title>
<para id="fs-idp126755792">Some animals, such as camels and alpacas, are pseudo-ruminants. They eat a lot of plant material and roughage. Digesting plant material is not easy because plant cell walls contain the polymeric sugar molecule cellulose. The digestive enzymes of these animals cannot break down cellulose, but microorganisms present in the digestive system can. Therefore, the digestive system must be able to handle large amounts of roughage and break down the cellulose. Pseudo-ruminants have a three-chamber stomach in the digestive system. However, their cecum—a pouched organ at the beginning of the large intestine containing many microorganisms that are necessary for the digestion of plant materials—is large and is the site where the roughage is fermented and digested. These animals do not have a rumen but have an omasum, abomasum, and reticulum.</para></section>

<title>Oral Cavity</title>
<para id="fs-idp135586480">The oral cavity, or mouth, is the point of entry of food into the digestive system, illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch34_01_08" document=""/>. The food consumed is broken into smaller particles by mastication, the chewing action of the teeth. All mammals have teeth and can chew their food.</para>
<para id="fs-idp41971632">The extensive chemical process of digestion begins in the mouth. As food is being chewed, saliva, produced by the salivary glands, mixes with the food. Saliva is a watery substance produced in the mouths of many animals. There are three major glands that secrete saliva—the parotid, the submandibular, and the sublingual. Saliva contains mucus that moistens food and buffers the pH of the food. Saliva also contains immunoglobulins and lysozymes, which have antibacterial action to reduce tooth decay by inhibiting growth of some bacteria. Saliva also contains an enzyme called <emphasis>salivary amylase</emphasis> that begins the process of converting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose. Another enzyme called <emphasis>lipase</emphasis> is produced by the cells in the tongue. Lipases are a class of enzymes that can break down triglycerides. The lingual lipase begins the breakdown of fat components in the food. The chewing and wetting action provided by the teeth and saliva prepare the food into a mass called the <emphasis>bolus</emphasis> for swallowing. The tongue helps in swallowing—moving the bolus from the mouth into the pharynx. The pharynx opens to two passageways: the trachea, which leads to the lungs, and the esophagus, which leads to the stomach. The trachea has an opening called the glottis, which is covered by a cartilaginous flap called the epiglottis. When swallowing, the epiglottis closes the glottis and food passes into the esophagus and not the trachea. This arrangement allows food to be kept out of the trachea.</para>

The peristalsis wave is unidirectional—it moves food from the mouth to the stomach, and reverse movement is not possible. The peristaltic movement of the esophagus is an involuntary reflex; it takes place in response to the act of swallowing.</para>

Acid reflux or “heartburn” occurs when the acidic digestive juices escape into the esophagus.</para>

</note><para id="fs-idp130425184">The stomach is the major site for protein digestion in animals other than ruminants. Protein digestion is mediated by an enzyme called pepsin in the stomach chamber. <emphasis>Pepsin</emphasis> is secreted by the chief cells in the stomach in an inactive form called <emphasis>pepsinogen</emphasis>. Pepsin breaks peptide bonds and cleaves proteins into smaller polypeptides; it also helps activate more pepsinogen, starting a positive feedback mechanism that generates more pepsin. Another cell type—parietal cells—secretes hydrogen and chloride ions, which combine in the lumen to form hydrochloric acid, the primary acidic component of the stomach juices. Hydrochloric acid helps to convert the inactive pepsinogen to pepsin. The highly acidic environment also kills many microorganisms in the food and, combined with the action of the enzyme pepsin, results in the hydrolysis of protein in the food. Chemical digestion is facilitated by the churning action of the stomach. Contraction and relaxation of smooth muscles mixes the stomach contents about every 20 minutes. The partially digested food and gastric juice mixture is called <emphasis>chyme</emphasis>. Chyme passes from the stomach to the small intestine. Further protein digestion takes place in the small intestine. Gastric emptying occurs within two to six hours after a meal. Only a small amount of chyme is released into the small intestine at a time. The movement of chyme from the stomach into the small intestine is regulated by the pyloric sphincter.</para><para id="fs-idp125384464">When digesting protein and some fats, the stomach lining must be protected from getting digested by pepsin. There are two points to consider when describing how the stomach lining is protected. First, as previously mentioned, the enzyme pepsin is synthesized in the inactive form. This protects the chief cells, because pepsinogen does not have the same enzyme functionality of pepsin. Second, the stomach has a thick mucus lining that protects the underlying tissue from the action of the digestive juices. When this mucus lining is ruptured, ulcers can form in the stomach. Ulcers are open wounds in or on an organ caused by bacteria (<emphasis effect="italics">Helicobacter pylori</emphasis>) when the mucus lining is ruptured and fails to reform.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-idp43421888">Different animals have evolved different types of digestive systems specialized to meet their dietary needs. Humans and many other animals have monogastric digestive systems with a single-chambered stomach. Birds have evolved a digestive system that includes a gizzard where the food is crushed into smaller pieces. This compensates for their inability to masticate. Ruminants that consume large amounts of plant material have a multi-chambered stomach that digests roughage. Pseudo-ruminants have similar digestive processes as ruminants but do not have the four-compartment stomach. Processing food involves ingestion (eating), digestion (mechanical and enzymatic breakdown of large molecules), absorption (cellular uptake of nutrients), and elimination (removal of undigested waste as feces).</para>
<para id="fs-idp22214512">Many organs work together to digest food and absorb nutrients. The mouth is the point of ingestion and the location where both mechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins. Saliva contains an enzyme called amylase that breaks down carbohydrates. The food bolus travels through the esophagus by peristaltic movements to the stomach. The stomach has an extremely acidic environment. An enzyme called pepsin digests protein in the stomach. Further digestion and absorption take place in the small intestine. The large intestine reabsorbs water from the undigested food and stores waste until elimination.</para>
