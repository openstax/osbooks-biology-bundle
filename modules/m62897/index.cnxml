<para id="fs-id1167065940922">We commonly think of pathogens when we think of prokaryotes, focusing on their relationship with disease. However, most prokaryotes do not cause disease and they play a wide range of other roles in ecosystems. Nitrogen needed to synthesize proteins and nucleic acids is often the most limiting element in ecosystems and bacteria are able to “fix” nitrogen into forms that can be used by eukaryotes. Microbes also are used to remove pollutants from environments, a process called <emphasis>bioremediation</emphasis>. Microbes that call us home are necessary for our survival. They help us digest our food, produce crucial nutrients, protect us from pathogenic microbes, and help train our immune system to function correctly. In addition, without prokaryotes we wouldn’t have cheese, bread, wine, beer, and yogurt.</para>

Many others have positive interactions with humans, and some play important roles in agriculture and industry. As students work through the chapter material, invite them to identify at least two ways prokaryotes have affected them in the day. You may wish to invite small groups to research additional roles of prokaryotes in the food industry, bioremediation, and the production of vitamins, antibiotics, hormones, and other products.

<title>Cooperation between Bacteria and Eukaryotes: Nitrogen Fixation</title>
<para id="fs-idp77772624">Nitrogen is a very important element to living things, because it is part of nucleotides and amino acids that are the building blocks of nucleic acids and proteins, respectively. Nitrogen is usually the most limiting element in terrestrial ecosystems, with atmospheric nitrogen, N<sub>2</sub>, providing the largest pool of available nitrogen. However, eukaryotes cannot use atmospheric, gaseous nitrogen to synthesize macromolecules. Fortunately, nitrogen can be “fixed,” meaning it is converted into ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) either biologically or abiotically. Abiotic nitrogen fixation occurs as a result of lightning or by industrial processes.</para>
<para id="fs-idp136134416"><emphasis>Biological nitrogen fixation</emphasis> (BNF) is exclusively carried out by prokaryotes: soil bacteria, cyanobacteria, and <emphasis effect="italics">Frankia</emphasis> spp. (filamentous bacteria interacting with actinorhizal plants such as alder, bayberry, and sweet fern). After photosynthesis, BNF is the second most important biological process on Earth. The equation representing the process is as follows</para>

<para id="fs-idp165163504">Cyanobacteria are the most important nitrogen fixers in aquatic environments. In soil, members of the genus <emphasis effect="italics">Clostridium</emphasis> are examples of free-living, nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Other bacteria live symbiotically with legume plants, providing the most important source of BNF. Symbionts may fix more nitrogen in soils than free-living organisms by a factor of 10. Soil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia, are able to symbiotically interact with legumes to form <emphasis>nodules</emphasis>, specialized structures where nitrogen fixation occurs (<link target-id="fig-ch22_05_01" document=""/>). Nitrogenase, the enzyme that fixes nitrogen, is inactivated by oxygen, so the nodule provides an oxygen-free area for nitrogen fixation to take place. This process provides a natural and inexpensive plant fertilizer, as it reduces atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, which is easily usable by plants. The use of legumes is an excellent alternative to chemical fertilization and is of special interest to sustainable agriculture, which seeks to minimize the use of chemicals and conserve natural resources. Through symbiotic nitrogen fixation, the plant benefits from using an endless source of nitrogen: the atmosphere. Bacteria benefit from using photosynthates (carbohydrates produced during photosynthesis) from the plant and having a protected niche. Additionally, the soil benefits from being naturally fertilized. Therefore, the use of rhizobia as biofertilizers is a sustainable practice.</para><para id="fs-idm61079952">Why are legumes so important? Some, like soybeans, are key sources of agricultural protein. Some of the most important grain legumes are soybean, peanuts, peas, chickpeas, and beans. Other legumes, such as alfalfa, are used to feed cattle.</para>

<title>Early Biotechnology: Cheese, Bread, and Yogurt</title>
<para id="fs-idm38795664">According to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, <emphasis>biotechnology</emphasis> is “any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use."<footnote id="fs-idm36724880">http://www.cbd.int/convention/articles/?a=cbd-02, United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity: Article 2: Use of Terms.</footnote> The concept of “specific use” involves some sort of commercial application. Genetic engineering, artificial selection, antibiotic production, and cell culture are current topics of study in biotechnology. However, humans have used prokaryotes before the term biotechnology was even coined. In addition, some of the goods and services are as simple as cheese, bread, and yogurt, which employ both bacteria and other microbes, such as yeast, a fungus.</para>
<para id="fs-idp122636224">Cheese production began around 4,000–7,000 years ago when humans began to breed animals and process their milk. Fermentation in this case preserves nutrients: Milk will spoil relatively quickly, but when processed as cheese, it is more stable Evidence suggests that cultured milk products, like yogurt, have existed for at least 4,000 years.</para>

<title>Using Prokaryotes to Clean up Our Planet: Bioremediation</title>
<para id="fs-idm36174032">Microbial <emphasis>bioremediation</emphasis> is the use of prokaryotes (or microbial metabolism) to remove pollutants. Bioremediation has been used to remove agricultural chemicals (pesticides, fertilizers) that leach from soil into groundwater and the subsurface. Certain toxic metals and oxides, such as selenium and arsenic compounds, can also be removed from water by bioremediation. The reduction of SeO<sub>4</sub><sup>-2</sup> to SeO<sub>3</sub><sup>-2</sup> and to Se<sup>0</sup> (metallic selenium) is a method used to remove selenium ions from water. Mercury is an example of a toxic metal that can be removed from an environment by bioremediation. As an active ingredient of some pesticides, mercury is used in industry and is also a by-product of certain processes, such as battery production. Methyl mercury is usually present in very low concentrations in natural environments, but it is highly toxic because it accumulates in living tissues. Several species of bacteria can carry out the biotransformation of toxic mercury into nontoxic forms. These bacteria, such as <emphasis effect="italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis>, can convert Hg<sup>+2</sup> into Hg<sup>0</sup>, which is nontoxic to humans.</para>
<para id="fs-idp21794192">One of the most useful and interesting examples of the use of prokaryotes for bioremediation purposes is the cleanup of oil spills. The importance of prokaryotes to petroleum bioremediation has been demonstrated in several oil spills in recent years, such as the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska (1989) (<link target-id="fig-ch22_05_03" document=""/>), the Prestige oil spill in Spain (2002), the spill into the Mediterranean from a Lebanon power plant (2006), and more recently, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (2010). To clean up these spills, bioremediation is promoted by the addition of inorganic nutrients that help bacteria to grow. Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria feed on hydrocarbons in the oil droplet, breaking down the hydrocarbons. Some species, such as <emphasis effect="italics">Alcanivorax borkumensis</emphasis>, produce surfactants that solubilize the oil, whereas other bacteria degrade the oil into carbon dioxide. In the case of oil spills in the ocean, ongoing, natural bioremediation tends to occur, inasmuch as there are oil-consuming bacteria in the ocean prior to the spill. In addition to naturally occurring oil-degrading bacteria, humans select and engineer bacteria that possess the same capability with increased efficacy and spectrum of hydrocarbon compounds that can be processed. Under ideal conditions, it has been reported that up to 80 percent of the nonvolatile components in oil can be degraded within one year of the spill. Other oil fractions containing aromatic and highly branched hydrocarbon chains are more difficult to remove and remain in the environment for longer periods of time.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167066195863">A particularly fascinating example of our normal flora relates to our digestive systems.

Obviously, trying to treat this problem with antibiotics only makes it worse. However, it has been successfully treated by giving the patients fecal transplants from healthy donors to reestablish the normal intestinal microbial community.

<problem id="fs-id1164965316753">
<para id="fs-id1164967551493">The human gut provides a habitat for approximately 100 trillion bacteria. Some sources claim that the surface area of the cells lining the small and large intestines is between 150 and 300 square meters and compare this area to that of a tennis court. Recent measurements, however, show that the surface area of the gut is closer to that of a studio apartment (Helander and Fandriks, <emphasis effect="italics">Jour. Gastro</emphasis>, 2014) and is roughly 50 square meters.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164959753024">A. <term>Calculate</term> the cellular surface area of the 100 trillion (10<sup>14</sup>) microbes in the typical human gut, assuming that the cells are spherical with an average radius of 0.001 mm. Use this calculated surface area to <term>predict</term> the relative rates of procurement of nutrients by both microbes and the host cells lining the large and small intestines.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164965258587">Humans compete with microbes for nutrients, but the relationship is mutually beneficial. Between 10 and 30% of ingested food remains undigested before reaching the large intestine. Some microbial waste products, particularly H<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>, are not resources for the host. But short-chain fatty acids like acetic, propionic, and butyric acids are resources that microbes extract from the undigested fraction. The large intestine of the adult human has a length of approximately 1.5 meters with a volume between 6 and 7 liters. The total volume of gut microbes is just a few hundred milliliters.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164965175028">B. <term>Predict</term> the length of a large intestine with equivalent recovery of resources and the same transit times through the bowel if, rather than 100 trillion organisms with a total volume of 1 L, there were 100 billion (10<sup>11</sup>) organisms, each with a volume of 10<sup>-8</sup> mL (the approximate volume of the epithelial cells lining the intestine).</para><para id="fs-id1164965545459">The relationship between gut microbes and their host is more complex than simple resource recovery, as shown in the figure of the microbiome below. PYY is a hormone that works with the enteric nervous system lining the intestinal wall to cause changes in the period of contractions of muscles (motility) that push material through the intestine.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164965657816">C. Based on the diagram, <term>summarize</term> the regulation of appetite by the microbiome and the elimination of waste by the host in terms of feedback loops and chemical signaling.</para>

The top right shows a magnified segment of large intestine. The segment labels the polysaccharides, bacteria and epithelial cells. The bottom right of the figure shows an increased magnification of the segment. Labeled inside the cells are the SCFA positive receptors, PYY, and G receptor cascade.

</figure><para id="fs-id1164965448259">The microbial population of the intestine is referred to as the microbiome. Undernutrition and obesity are both symptoms of malnutrition, and populations of the microbiome vary with the type of malnutrition (Brown et al., <emphasis effect="italics">Nutr Clin Pract</emphasis>, 2012). The microbiome of humans can be transplanted into germ-free (GF) mice to observe the effects of diet in a controlled experiment of relatively short duration. The microbiomes of healthy and undernourished 6-month-old children were transplanted into GF mice whose growth is graphed below. Growth in both length and weight were reduced when the source of the microbiome was the undernourished child (after Blanton et al., <emphasis effect="italics">Science</emphasis>, 2016). Both groups of mice were provided with the same nutritional resources.</para>

The red line is labeled as Microbiome from undernourished 6 month old child.">

<para id="fs-id1164967522616">Human growth hormone stimulates the release of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). IGF-1 is a messenger that activates the production of bone cells called osteocytes. The data (after Schwarzer et al., <emphasis effect="italics">Science</emphasis>, 2016) show concentrations of this growth factor in mice with no microbiome (GF), wild-type mice whose microbiome and growth provide a control (WT), and mice whose microbiome population is composed entirely of <emphasis effect="italics">Lactobacillus plantarum</emphasis> (two strains labeled L1 and L2). <emphasis effect="italics">Lactobacillus</emphasis> is one of many hundred genera of microbial inhabitants of a healthy human intestine.</para>
