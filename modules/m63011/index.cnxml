<title>Connection for AP<sup>®</sup> Courses</title>
<para id="fs-id1167064564110">Much of the information about the different reproductive systems of animals is not within the scope for AP<sup>®</sup>. You likely studied human reproduction in a health course or previous biology course. Reproduction is necessary for the survival of a species, and animals have evolved various reproductive strategies. In a previous chapter we learned that asexual reproduction via mitosis produces genetically identical organisms (clones). We also previously explored how meiosis followed by <emphasis>sexual reproduction</emphasis> produces offspring that are genetically different from their parents. Whether or not the material in this chapter is required or illustrative as part of your AP<sup>®</sup> course, you should find the concepts interesting and relevant to your lives outside the classroom.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167066145821" class="ost-reading-discard">Both asexual and sexual reproductive strategies have their advantages and disadvantages. Organisms that reproduce asexually—for example, bacteria and some eukaryotes—may be at a disadvantage in an unstable or unpredictable environment because, barring mutation, the identical offspring may not have sufficient genetic variation to survive in new or different conditions. On the other hand, the rapid rates of <emphasis>asexual reproduction</emphasis> may allow a speedy response to changing environmental conditions. Although sexual reproduction allows for greater genetic variation in offspring, organisms that reproduce sexually must maintain males and females in the population, which can limit the ability to colonize new habitats.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065949174" class="ost-reading-discard">Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP<sup>®</sup> Biology Curriculum Framework. The AP<sup>®</sup> Learning Objectives listed in the Curriculum Framework provide a transparent foundation for the AP<sup>®</sup> Biology course, an inquiry-based laboratory experience, instructional activities, and AP<sup>®</sup> exam questions.

<title>Asexual Reproduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm55969744">Asexual reproduction occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms (bacteria) and in some eukaryotic single-celled and multi-celled organisms. There are a number of ways that animals reproduce asexually.</para>
<section id="fs-idp60153344" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch34-s01-aplo-3-9">
<title>Fission</title>
<para id="fs-idm171341232"><emphasis>Fission</emphasis>, also called binary fission, occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms and in some invertebrate, multi-celled organisms. After a period of growth, an organism splits into two separate organisms. Some unicellular eukaryotic organisms undergo binary fission by mitosis. In other organisms, part of the individual separates and forms a second individual. This process occurs, for example, in many asteroid echinoderms through splitting of the central disk. Some sea anemones and some coral polyps (<link target-id="fig-ch43_01_01" document=""/>) also reproduce through fission.</para>

<title>Budding</title>
<para id="fs-idm53617040"><emphasis>Budding</emphasis> is a form of asexual reproduction that results from the outgrowth of a part of a cell or body region leading to a separation from the original organism into two individuals. Budding occurs commonly in some invertebrate animals such as corals and hydras. In hydras, a bud forms that develops into an adult and breaks away from the main body, as illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch43_01_02" document=""/>, whereas in coral budding, the bud does not detach and multiplies as part of a new colony.</para>

<title>Fragmentation</title>
<para id="fs-idm13070448"><emphasis>Fragmentation</emphasis> is the breaking of the body into two parts with subsequent regeneration. If the animal is capable of fragmentation, and the part is big enough, a separate individual will regrow.</para>
<para id="fs-idm131574176">For example, in many sea stars, asexual reproduction is accomplished by fragmentation. <link target-id="fig-ch43_01_03" document=""/> illustrates a sea star for which an arm of the individual is broken off and regenerates a new sea star. Fisheries workers have been known to try to kill the sea stars eating their clam or oyster beds by cutting them in half and throwing them back into the ocean. Unfortunately for the workers, the two parts can each regenerate a new half, resulting in twice as many sea stars to prey upon the oysters and clams. Fragmentation also occurs in annelid worms, turbellarians, and poriferans.</para>

<section id="fs-idm25326192">
<title>Parthenogenesis</title>
<para id="fs-idp36672416"><emphasis>Parthenogenesis</emphasis> is a form of asexual reproduction where an egg develops into a complete individual without being fertilized. The resulting offspring can be either haploid or diploid, depending on the process and the species. Parthenogenesis occurs in invertebrates such as water flees, rotifers, aphids, stick insects, some ants, wasps, and bees. Bees and wasps use parthenogenesis to produce haploid males (called drones). If an egg is fertilized, it develops as a diploid female.</para><para id="fs-idm106900496">Some vertebrate animals—such as certain reptiles, amphibians, and fish—also reproduce through parthenogenesis. Although more common in plants, parthenogenesis has been observed in animal species that were segregated by sex in terrestrial or marine zoos. Two female Komodo dragons, a hammerhead shark, and a blacktop shark have produced parthenogenic young when the females have been isolated from males.</para>

<title>Sexual Reproduction</title>
<para id="fs-idm17022464">Sexual reproduction is the combination of (usually haploid) reproductive cells from two individuals to form a third (usually diploid) unique offspring. Sexual reproduction produces offspring with novel combinations of genes. This can be an adaptive advantage in unstable or unpredictable environments. As humans, we are used to thinking of animals as having two separate sexes—male and female—determined at conception. However, in the animal kingdom, there are many variations on this theme.</para>

<title>Hermaphroditism</title>
<para id="fs-idp77043680"><emphasis>Hermaphroditism</emphasis> occurs in animals where one individual has both male and female reproductive parts. Invertebrates such as earthworms, slugs, tapeworms and snails, shown in <link target-id="fig-ch43_01_04" document=""/>, are often hermaphroditic. Hermaphrodites may self-fertilize or may mate with another of their species, fertilizing each other and both producing offspring.

<title>Sex Determination</title>
<para id="fs-idp7715840">Mammalian sex determination is determined genetically by the presence of X and Y chromosomes. Individuals homozygous for X (XX) are female and heterozygous individuals (XY) are male. The presence of a Y chromosome causes the development of male characteristics and its absence results in female characteristics. The XY system is also found in some insects and plants.</para>
<para id="fs-idm172007152">Avian sex determination is dependent on the presence of Z and W chromosomes. Homozygous for Z (ZZ) results in a male and heterozygous (ZW) results in a female. The W appears to be essential in determining the sex of the individual, similar to the Y chromosome in mammals. Some fish, crustaceans, insects (such as butterflies and moths), and reptiles use this system.</para>
<para id="fs-idm72903392">The sex of some species is not determined by genetics but by some aspect of the environment. Sex determination in some crocodiles and turtles, for example, is often dependent on the temperature during critical periods of egg development. This is referred to as environmental sex determination, or more specifically as temperature-dependent sex determination. In many turtles, cooler temperatures during egg incubation produce males and warm temperatures produce females. In some crocodiles, moderate temperatures produce males and both warm and cool temperatures produce females. In some species, sex is both genetic- and temperature-dependent.</para>
<para id="fs-idm117915392">Individuals of some species change their sex during their lives, alternating between male and female. If the individual is female first, it is termed protogyny or “first female,” if it is male first, its termed protandry or “first male.” Oysters, for example, are born male, grow, and become female and lay eggs; some oyster species change sex multiple times.</para>

<para id="fs-id1166170453850">Humans are bilateral and have biaxial symmetry. However, small variations in body symmetry occur.  One foot may be slightly larger than another and we might never know. Because the eyes are so important in communication the condition called heterochromia iridium is very noticeable. Body plans are very noticeable aspects of the phenotype.</para>
<para id="fs-id1166166006374">In guppy courtship the male displays himself to the female. Some males are more orange than others and some males have asymmetry with one side being more brightly colored orange than the other side.  A pattern in the courtship display is shown in the graphs (Gross et al., <emphasis effect="italics">Proceedings of the Royal Society B:Biological Sciences</emphasis>, 274, 2007).</para><figure id="fs-id1166165867581"><media id="fs-id1166169521600" alt="This figure is a graph that has a vertical axis labeled Female preference and a horizontal axis labeled Male orange Color. Majority of the orange dots cluster about a quarter into the line and hover closer to it with some of them variously underneath the line and a few orange dots to the upper right corner. The second graph is labeled on the vertical axis Male Display asymmetry and the horizontal line labeled Male orange asymmetry. Most of the dots clutter along the diagonal line.">

<para id="fs-id1166170649787">If there were no process that maintained variation in the gene controlling the orange coloration then perhaps all male guppies would symmetrically bright orange. Yet variation remains.</para>
<para id="fs-id1166172915027">B. A guppy is a small fish and small fish are eaten by bigger fish. <emphasis>Make and justify</emphasis> a claim regarding the effect of allelic variation on the stability of the guppy population.</para>
<para id="fs-id1166172608316">Phenotype is an expression of the genotype and within a population genotypic variation occurs. For a population to maintain stability in a changing environment genetic variation within the population provides selective advantage at the population level.  </para>
<para id="fs-id1166174739841">C. <emphasis>Make and justify</emphasis> a claim regarding the effect of genetic variation in guppies on the stability of an ecosystem of which the guppy is a member.</para>
<para id="fs-id1166164951147">The fluctuation of symmetry in body plan of an organism, such as the asymmetry of guppy coloration, is unusual.  Large scale fluctuations where the fully developed organism is viable, such as the emergence of an appendage from the eye of the <emphasis effect="italics">Drosophila</emphasis>, are very rare. The overall body plan is controlled in <emphasis effect="italics">Drosophila</emphasis> by a cluster of genes called the Hox genes. In the fruit fly there is a single cluster and the arrangement of genes in the genome is a map of the anterior to posterior body plan.  In all vertebrate multiple Hox clusters control the development of the body plan and they too show the sequential anterior to posterior arrangement in the genome. </para>
<para id="fs-id1166165857904">D. During development the transcription factors expressed by the Hox genes initiate and terminate the expression of specialized cells and tissues. <emphasis>Describe</emphasis> the evidence for shared ancestry in this conserved strategy for communication between cells through regulation of transcription factors.</para>
<para id="fs-id1166170344369">E. <emphasis>Describe</emphasis> one other example of conserved core shared by all domains or within one domain.</para>
