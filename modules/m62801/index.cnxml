<label>Background Information</label>
<para id="fs-id1167067070442">Unicellular organisms were assumed to communicate at a very primitive level, but current research reveals the existence more complex signaling systems. Examples of these forms of communication are the formation of biofilms and quorum sensing. Biofilms have received the attention of researchers only recently for several historical and technical reasons. Since the germ theory of disease was established, the interest had been to isolate and characterize pathogens, not to study microorganisms as a community.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167067009633">It is much easier to grow bacteria as pure cultures than replicate mixed populations biofilms, making the latter difficult to study in the laboratory setting. Such slime layers, previously considered haphazard assemblies of microorganisms, have been found to be highly organized ecosystems. The slime layer is made of extracellular polymers crisscrossed with channels for gases, nutrients, waste exchanges. Microbes attach to the solid substrate in a succession of populations.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167067054646">Quorum sensing exists both within a same species and across species. It allows microbes to behave as multicellular populations and coordinate responses. One such example is the expression of genes encoding toxins in <emphasis effect="italics">Staphylococcus aureus</emphasis>.

Budding yeasts (<link target-id="fig-ch09_04_01" document=""/>) are able to participate in a process that is similar to sexual reproduction that entails two haploid cells (cells with one-half the normal number of chromosomes) combining to form a diploid cell (a cell with two sets of each chromosome, which is what normal body cells contain). In order to find another haploid yeast cell that is prepared to mate, budding yeasts secrete a signaling molecule called <term>mating factor</term>. When mating factor binds to cell-surface receptors in other yeast cells that are nearby, they stop their normal growth cycles and initiate a cell signaling cascade that includes protein kinases and GTP-binding proteins that are similar to G-proteins.</para>

<title>Signaling in Bacteria</title>
<para id="fs-id1417852">Signaling in bacteria enables bacteria to monitor extracellular conditions, ensure that there are sufficient amounts of nutrients, and ensure that hazardous situations are avoided. There are circumstances, however, when bacteria communicate with each other.</para>
<para id="fs-id2201059">The first evidence of bacterial communication was observed in a bacterium that has a symbiotic relationship with Hawaiian bobtail squid. When the population density of the bacteria reaches a certain level, specific gene expression is initiated, and the bacteria produce bioluminescent proteins that emit light. Because the number of cells present in the environment (cell density) is the determining factor for signaling, bacterial signaling was named <term>quorum sensing</term>. In politics and business, a quorum is the minimum number of members required to be present to vote on an issue.</para>
<para id="fs-id1419717">Quorum sensing uses autoinducers as signaling molecules. <term>Autoinducers</term> are signaling molecules secreted by bacteria to communicate with other bacteria of the same kind. The secreted autoinducers can be small, hydrophobic molecules such as acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) or larger peptide-based molecules; each type of molecule has a different mode of action. When AHL enters target bacteria, it binds to transcription factors, which then switch gene expression on or off (<link target-id="fig-ch09_04_02" document=""/>). The peptide autoinducers stimulate more complicated signaling pathways that include bacterial kinases. The changes in bacteria following exposure to autoinducers can be quite extensive. The pathogenic bacterium <emphasis effect="italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</emphasis> has 616 different genes that respond to autoinducers.</para><note id="fs-id1650052" class="visual-connection ost-assessed-feature"><label>Visual Connection</label>

</note><para id="fs-id2962722">Some species of bacteria that use quorum sensing form biofilms, complex colonies of bacteria (often containing several species) that exchange chemical signals to coordinate the release of toxins that will attack the host. Bacterial biofilms (<link target-id="fig-ch09_04_03" document=""/>) can sometimes be found on medical equipment; when biofilms invade implants such as hip or knee replacements or heart pacemakers, they can cause life-threatening infections.</para>
<para id="fs-id1166169385753">The ability of certain bacteria to form biofilms has evolved because of a selection of genes that enable cell-cell communication confers an evolutionary advantage. When bacterial colonies form biofilms, they create barriers that prevent toxins and antibacterial drugs from affecting the population living in the biofilm. As a result, these populations are more likely to survive, even in the presence of antibacterial agents. This often means that bacteria living in biofilms have higher fitness than bacteria living on their own.</para>

Presumably, unicellular organisms do not need to coordinate the response of many tissue types and organs.

<para id="fs-id2570933">The first life on our planet consisted of single-celled prokaryotic organisms that had limited interaction with each other. While some external signaling occurs between different species of single-celled organisms, the majority of signaling within bacteria and yeasts concerns only other members of the same species. The evolution of cellular communication is an absolute necessity for the development of multicellular organisms, and this innovation is thought to have required approximately 2.5 billion years to appear in early life forms.</para>
<para id="fs-id2165327">Yeasts are single-celled eukaryotes, and therefore have a nucleus and organelles characteristic of more complex life forms. Comparisons of the genomes of yeasts, nematode worms, fruit flies, and humans illustrate the evolution of increasingly complex signaling systems that allow for the efficient inner workings that keep humans and other complex life forms functioning correctly.</para>
<para id="fs-id1723818">Kinases are a major component of cellular communication, and studies of these enzymes illustrate the evolutionary connectivity of different species. Yeasts have 130 types of kinases. More complex organisms such as nematode worms and fruit flies have 454 and 239 kinases, respectively. Of the 130 kinase types in yeast, 97 belong to the 55 subfamilies of kinases that are found in other eukaryotic organisms. The only obvious deficiency seen in yeasts is the complete absence of tyrosine kinases. It is hypothesized that phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is needed to control the more sophisticated functions of development, differentiation, and cellular communication used in multicellular organisms.</para>
<para id="fs-id1910465">Because yeasts contain many of the same classes of signaling proteins as humans, these organisms are ideal for studying signaling cascades. Yeasts multiply quickly and are much simpler organisms than humans or other multicellular animals. Therefore, the signaling cascades are also simpler and easier to study, although they contain similar counterparts to human signaling. <footnote id="fn-ch09_04_01">G. Manning, G.D. Plowman, T.

Antibiotics also are produced industrially in large bacteria-containing fermentation tanks.  However, antibiotics that have been used by humans to control microbes are now found at subinhibitory concentrations in the environment.  Low levels of antibiotics in the environment are mutagenic for bacteria and promote the development of antibiotic resistance.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164967560114">Bacteria produce chemical signals that detect population density and regulate gene expression, a phenomenon called quorum sensing.  Density is signaled by the extracellular concentration of small amino acid derivatives.  To combat antibiotic resistance, an emerging strategy for the control of bacterial disease is quorum quenching.</para>
