<title>Connection for AP<sup>®</sup> Courses</title><para id="fs-id1167063517781">The Watson and Crick model suggested a way in which DNA could be replicated during cell division. Basically, the two strands unwind and separate where the hydrogen bonds connect the nucleotides. Each parental strand then serves as a template for a new, complementary daughter strand. Replication is said to be semi-conservative because the original information encoded in each parental strand is conserved (kept) in the daughter molecules. Thus, a newly replicated molecule of DNA consists of one “old” strand and one “new” strand. Meselson and Stahl used density differences in nitrogen isotopes to investigate replication, and their experiments supported the semi-conservative model. However, the process of replication is more complex than their model’s simple description.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167067043894">Before the Meselson and Stahl experiment in 1958, scientists did not know how chromosomes replicated.

This model suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied. What was not clear was how the replication took place. There were three models suggested (<link target-id="fig-ch14_03_01"/>): conservative, semi-conservative, and dispersive.</para>

In the dispersive model, both copies of DNA have double-stranded segments of parental DNA and newly synthesized DNA interspersed.</para>
    <para id="fs-id2216817">Meselson and Stahl were interested in understanding how DNA replicates. They grew <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> for several generations in a medium containing a “heavy” isotope of nitrogen (<sup>15</sup>N) that gets incorporated into nitrogenous bases, and eventually into the DNA (<link target-id="fig-ch14_03_02"/>).</para>

<caption>Meselson and Stahl experimented with <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> grown first in heavy nitrogen (<sup>15</sup>N) then in <sup>14</sup>N. DNA grown in <sup>15</sup>N (red band) is heavier than DNA grown in <sup>14</sup>N (orange band), and sediments to a lower level in cesium chloride solution in an ultracentrifuge. When DNA grown in <sup>15</sup>N is switched to media containing <sup>14</sup>N, after one round of cell division the DNA sediments halfway between the <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>14</sup>N levels, indicating that it now contains fifty percent <sup>14</sup>N. In subsequent cell divisions, an increasing amount of DNA contains <sup>14</sup>N only. This data supports the semi-conservative replication model. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)</caption></figure><para id="fs-id2589720">The <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> culture was then shifted into medium containing <sup>14</sup>N and allowed to grow for one generation. The cells were harvested and the DNA was isolated. The DNA was centrifuged at high speeds in an ultracentrifuge. Some cells were allowed to grow for one more life cycle in <sup>14</sup>N and spun again. During the density gradient centrifugation, the DNA is loaded into a gradient (typically a salt such as cesium chloride or sucrose) and spun at high speeds of 50,000 to 60,000 rpm. Under these circumstances, the DNA will form a band according to its density in the gradient. DNA grown in <sup>15</sup>N will band at a higher density position than that grown in <sup>14</sup>N. Meselson and Stahl noted that after one generation of growth in <sup>14</sup>N after they had been shifted from <sup>15</sup>N, the single band observed was intermediate in position in between DNA of cells grown exclusively in<sup> 15</sup>N and <sup>14</sup>N. This suggested either a semi-conservative or dispersive mode of replication. The DNA harvested from cells grown for two generations in <sup>14</sup>N formed two bands: one DNA band was at the intermediate position between <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>14</sup>N, and the other corresponded to the band of <sup>14</sup>N DNA. These results could only be explained if DNA replicates in a semi-conservative manner. Therefore, the other two modes were ruled out.</para>
<para id="fs-id2854117">During DNA replication, each of the two strands that make up the double helix serves as a template from which new strands are copied. The new strand will be complementary to the parental or “old” strand. When two daughter DNA copies are formed, they have the same sequence and are divided equally into the two daughter cells.</para>
