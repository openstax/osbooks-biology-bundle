<para id="fs-id1167066112241">The regulation of gene expression in prokaryotic cells occurs at the transcriptional level. Simply stated, if a cell does not transcribe the DNA’s message into mRNA, translation (protein synthesis), does not occur. Bacterial genes are often organized into common pathways or processes called operons for more coordinated regulation of expression. For example, in <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis>, genes responsible for lactose metabolism are located together on the bacterial chromosome. (The operon model includes several components, so when studying how the operon works, it is helpful to refer to a diagram of the model. See <link target-id="fig-ch16_02_01"/> and <link target-id="fig-ch16_02_02"/>.) The operon includes a regulatory gene that codes for a repressor protein that binds to the operator, which prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the gene(s) of interest. An example of this is seen in the structural genes for lactose metabolism. However, if the repressor is inactivated, RNA polymerase binds to the promoter, and transcription of the structural genes occurs.</para><para id="fs-id1167066033378">There are three ways to control the transcription of an operon: inducible control, repressible control, and activator control. The <emphasis effect="italics">lac </emphasis>operon is an example of inducible control because the presence of lactose “turns on” transcription of the genes for its own metabolism. The <emphasis effect="italics">trp </emphasis>operon is an example of repressible control because it uses proteins bound to the operator sequence to physically prevent the binding of RNA polymerase. If tryptophan is not needed by the cell, the genes necessary to produce it are turned off. Activator control (typified by the action of Catabolite Activator Protein) increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter. Certain genes are continually expressed via this regulatory mechanism.</para>

<title>Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP): An Activator Regulator</title>
<para id="fs-idm148740496">Just as the <emphasis effect="italics">trp</emphasis> operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules, there are proteins that bind to the operator sequences that act as a <term id="term-00009">positive regulator</term> to turn genes on and activate them. For example, when glucose is scarce, <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> bacteria can turn to other sugar sources for fuel. To do this, new genes to process these alternate genes must be transcribed. When glucose levels drop, cyclic AMP (cAMP) begins to accumulate in the cell. The cAMP molecule is a signaling molecule that is involved in glucose and energy metabolism in <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis>. When glucose levels decline in the cell, accumulating cAMP binds to the positive regulator <term id="term-00010">catabolite activator protein (CAP)</term>, a protein that binds to the promoters of operons that control the processing of alternative sugars. When cAMP binds to CAP, the complex binds to the promoter region of the genes that are needed to use the alternate sugar sources (<link target-id="fig-ch16_02_02"/>). In these operons, a CAP binding site is located upstream of the RNA polymerase binding site in the promoter. This increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter region and the transcription of the genes.</para>

However, for the <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operon to be activated, two conditions must be met. First, the level of glucose must be very low or non-existent. Second, lactose must be present. Only when glucose is absent and lactose is present will the <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operon be transcribed (<link target-id="fig-ch16_02_03"/>).

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-idm214780208">The regulation of gene expression in prokaryotic cells occurs at the transcriptional level. There are three ways to control the transcription of an operon: repressive control, activator control, and inducible control. Repressive control, typified by the<emphasis effect="italics"> trp</emphasis> operon, uses proteins bound to the operator sequence to physically prevent the binding of RNA polymerase and the activation of transcription. Therefore, if tryptophan is not needed, the repressor is bound to the operator and transcription remains off. Activator control, typified by the action of CAP, increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter when CAP is bound. In this case, low levels of glucose result in the binding of cAMP to CAP. CAP then binds the promoter, which allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter better. In the last example—the <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operon—two conditions must be met to initiate transcription. Glucose must not be present, and lactose must be available for the <emphasis effect="italics">lac</emphasis> operon to be transcribed. If glucose is absent, CAP binds to the operator. If lactose is present, the repressor protein does not bind to its operator. Only when both conditions are met will RNA polymerase bind to the promoter to induce transcription.</para>
