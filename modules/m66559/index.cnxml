<para id="fs-idp13116032">The kingdom Fungi contains five major phyla that were established according to their mode of sexual reproduction or using molecular data. Unrelated fungi that reproduce without a sexual cycle, were once placed for convenience in a sixth group, the Deuteromycota, called a “form phylum,” because superficially they appeared to be similar, a <term id="term-00017">polyphyletic</term> group (group of organisms that is of mixed evolutionary origin). However, most mycologists have discontinued this practice. Rapid advances in molecular biology and the sequencing of 18S rRNA (ribosomal RNA) continue to show new and different relationships among the various categories of fungi.</para>
<para id="fs-idm89338640">The five true phyla of fungi are the Chytridiomycota (Chytrids), the Zygomycota (conjugated fungi), the Ascomycota (sac fungi), the Basidiomycota (club fungi) and the recently described Phylum Glomeromycota (<link target-id="fig-ch24_02_01a"/>).</para>

<title>Chytridiomycota: The Chytrids</title>
<para id="fs-idm37155376">The only class in the Phylum Chytridiomycota is the <term id="term-00001">Chytridiomycetes</term>. The chytrids are the simplest and most primitive Eumycota, or true fungi. The evolutionary record shows that the first recognizable chytrids appeared during the late pre-Cambrian period, more than 500 million years ago. Like all fungi, chytrids have chitin in their cell walls, but one group of chytrids has both cellulose and chitin in the cell wall. Most chytrids are unicellular; however, a few form multicellular organisms and hyphae, which have no septa between cells (coenocytic). The Chytrids are the only fungi that have retained flagella. They produce both gametes and diploid zoospores that swim with the help of a single flagellum. An unusual feature of the chytrids is that both male and female gametes are flagellated.</para>
<para id="fs-idm101303296">The ecological habitat and cell structure of chytrids have much in common with protists. Chytrids usually live in aquatic environments, although some species live on land. Some species thrive as parasites on plants, insects, or amphibians (<link target-id="fig-ch24_02_01"/>), while others are saprobes. The chytrid species <emphasis effect="italics">Allomyces</emphasis> is well characterized as an experimental organism. Its reproductive cycle includes both asexual and sexual phases. <emphasis effect="italics">Allomyces </emphasis>produces diploid or haploid flagellated zoospores in a sporangium.</para>

<title>Zygomycota: The Conjugated Fungi</title>
<para id="fs-idm96467152">The zygomycetes are a relatively small group of fungi belonging to the Phylum <term id="term-00002">Zygomycota</term>. They include the familiar bread mold, <emphasis effect="italics">Rhizopus stolonifer</emphasis>, which rapidly propagates on the surfaces of breads, fruits, and vegetables. Most species are saprobes, living off decaying organic material; a few are parasites, particularly of insects. Zygomycetes play a considerable commercial role. For example, the metabolic products of some species of <emphasis effect="italics">Rhizopus</emphasis> are intermediates in the synthesis of semi-synthetic steroid hormones.</para>
<para id="fs-idp48035248">Zygomycetes have a thallus of coenocytic hyphae in which the nuclei are haploid when the organism is in the vegetative stage. The fungi usually reproduce asexually by producing sporangiospores (<link target-id="fig-ch24_02_02"/>). The black tips of bread mold are the swollen sporangia packed with black spores (<link target-id="fig-ch24_02_03"/>). When spores land on a suitable substrate, they germinate and produce a new mycelium. Sexual reproduction starts when environmental conditions become unfavorable. Two opposing mating strains (type + and type –) must be in close proximity for gametangia from the hyphae to be produced and fuse, leading to karyogamy. Each zygospore can contain several diploid nuclei. The developing diploid <term id="term-00003">zygospores</term> have thick coats that protect them from desiccation and other hazards. They may remain dormant until environmental conditions are favorable. When the zygospore germinates, it undergoes meiosis and produces haploid spores, which will, in turn, grow into a new organism. This form of sexual reproduction in fungi is called conjugation (although it differs markedly from conjugation in bacteria and protists), giving rise to the name “conjugated fungi”.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch24_02_02"><media id="fs-idp77267904" alt="The asexual and sexual life cycles of zygomycetes are shown. In the asexual life cycle, 1n spores undergo mitosis to form long chains of cells called mycelia. Germination results in the formation of more spores. In the sexual life cycle, spores germinate to form mycelia with two different mating types: plus and minus. If the plus and minus mating types are in close proximity, extensions called gametangia form between them. In a process called plasmogamy, the gametangia fuse to form a zygosporangium with multiple haploid nuclei. A thick, protective coat forms around the zygosporangium. In a process called karyogamy, the nuclei fuse to form a zygote with multiple diploid (2n) nuclei. The zygote undergoes meiosis and germination. A sporangium grows on a short stalk. Haploid spores are formed inside. The spores germinate, ending the cycle.">

<title>Ascomycota: The Sac Fungi</title>
<para id="fs-idp2624016">The majority of known fungi belong to the Phylum <term id="term-00004">Ascomycota</term>, which is characterized by the formation of an <term id="term-00005">ascus</term> (plural, asci), a sac-like structure that contains haploid <emphasis effect="italics">ascospores</emphasis>. Filamentous ascomycetes produce hyphae divided by perforated septa, allowing streaming of cytoplasm from one cell to another. Conidia and asci, which are used respectively for asexual and sexual reproduction, are usually separated from the vegetative hyphae by blocked (non-perforated) septa. Many ascomycetes are of commercial importance. Some play a beneficial role for humanity, such as the yeasts used in baking, brewing, and wine fermentation, and directly as food delicacies such as truffles and morels. <emphasis effect="italics">Aspergillus oryzae</emphasis> is used in the fermentation of rice to produce sake. Other ascomycetes parasitize plants and animals, including humans. For example, fungal pneumonia poses a significant threat to AIDS patients who have a compromised immune system. Ascomycetes not only infest and destroy crops directly; they also produce poisonous secondary metabolites that make crops unfit for consumption.</para>
<para id="fs-idm90354416">Asexual reproduction is frequent and involves the production of conidiophores that release haploid <emphasis effect="italics">conidiospores</emphasis> (<link target-id="fig-ch24_02_04"/>). Sexual reproduction starts with the development of special hyphae from either one of two types of mating strains (<link target-id="fig-ch24_02_04"/>). The “male” strain produces an antheridium and the “female” strain develops an ascogonium. At fertilization, the antheridium and the ascogonium combine in plasmogamy, without nuclear fusion. Special dikaryotic ascogenous (ascus-producing) hyphae arise from this <term id="term-00006">dikaryon</term>, in which each cell has pairs of nuclei: one from the “male” strain and one from the “female” strain. In each ascus, two haploid nuclei fuse in karyogamy. Thousands of asci fill a fruiting body called the <term id="term-00007">ascocarp</term>. The diploid nucleus in each ascus gives rise to haploid nuclei by meiosis, and spore walls form around each nucleus. The spores in each ascus contain the meiotic products of a single diploid nucleus. The ascospores are then released, germinate, and form hyphae that are disseminated in the environment and start new mycelia (<link target-id="fig-ch24_02_05"/>).</para>
<note id="fs-idp5727936" class="visual-connection">
<figure id="fig-ch24_02_04"><media id="fs-idm91310096" alt=" Ascomycetes have both sexual and asexual life cycles. In the asexual life cycle, the haploid (1n) mycelium branches into a chain of cells called the conidiophore. Spores bud from the end of the conidiophore and germinate to form more mycelia. In the sexual life cycle, a round structure called an antheridium buds from the male strain, and a similar structure called the ascogonium buds from the female strain. In a process called plasmogamy, the ascogonium and antheridium fuse to form a cell with multiple haploid nuclei. Mitosis and cell division result in the growth of many hyphae, which form a fruiting body called the ascocarp. The hyphae are dikaryotic, meaning they have two haploid nuclei. Asci form at the tips of these hyphae. In a process called karyogamy, the nuclei in the asci fuse to form a diploid (2n) zygote. The zygote undergoes meiosis without cell division, resulting in an ascus with four 1n nuclei arranged in a row. Each nucleus undergoes mitosis, resulting in eight ascospores, which are also arranged in a row at the tip of the hyphae. Dispersal and germination results in the growth of new mycelia.">

<title>Basidiomycota: The Club Fungi</title>
<para id="fs-idm90421168">The fungi in the Phylum <term id="term-00008">Basidiomycota</term> are easily recognizable under a light microscope by their club-shaped fruiting bodies called <term id="term-00009">basidia</term> (singular, <term id="term-00010">basidium</term>), which are the swollen terminal cells of hyphae. The basidia, which are the reproductive organs of these fungi, are often contained within the familiar mushroom, commonly seen in fields after rain, on the supermarket shelves, and growing on your lawn (<link target-id="fig-ch24_02_06"/>). These mushroom-producing basidiomycetes are sometimes referred to as <emphasis effect="italics">“gill fungi”</emphasis> because of the presence of gill-like structures on the underside of the cap. The gills are actually <emphasis effect="italics">compacted hyphae</emphasis> on which the basidia are borne. This group also includes shelf fungi, which cling to the bark of trees like small shelves. In addition, the basidiomycota include smuts and rusts, which are important plant pathogens. Most edible fungi belong to the Phylum Basidiomycota; however, some basidiomycota are inedible and produce deadly toxins. For example, <emphasis effect="italics">Cryptococcus neoformans</emphasis> causes severe respiratory illness. The infamous death cap mushroom (<emphasis effect="italics">Amanita phalloides</emphasis>) is related to the fly agaric seen at the beginning of the previous section.</para>

<caption>Fairy ring.

The body of this fungus, its mycelium, is underground and grows outward in a circle. As it grows, the mycelium depletes the soil of nitrogen, causing the mycelia to grow away from the center and leading to the “fairy ring” of fruiting bodies where there is adequate soil nitrogen.

Most fungi are haploid through most of their life cycles, but the basidiomycetes produce <emphasis effect="italics">both</emphasis> haploid and dikaryotic mycelia, with the dikaryotic phase being dominant. (Note: The dikaryotic phase is technically not diploid, since the nuclei remain unfused until shortly before spore production.) In the basidiomycetes, sexual spores are more common than asexual spores. The sexual spores form in the club-shaped basidium and are called basidiospores. In the basidium, nuclei of two different mating strains fuse (karyogamy), giving rise to a diploid zygote that then undergoes meiosis. The haploid nuclei migrate into four different chambers appended to the basidium, and then become basidiospores.</para><para id="fs-idm87879556">Each basidiospore germinates and generates <emphasis effect="italics">monokaryotic haploid hyphae</emphasis>.

This is the dominant dikaryotic stage of the basidiomycete life cycle. Thus, each cell in this mycelium has two haploid nuclei, which will not fuse until formation of the basidium. Eventually, the secondary mycelium generates a <term id="term-00011">basidiocarp</term>, a fruiting body that protrudes from the ground—this is what we think of as a mushroom.

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-idp42314960">Chytridiomycota (chytrids) are considered the most ancestral group of fungi. They are mostly aquatic, and their gametes are the only fungal cells known to have flagella. They reproduce both sexually and asexually; the asexual spores are called zoospores. Zygomycota (conjugated fungi) produce non-septate hyphae with many nuclei. Their hyphae fuse during sexual reproduction to produce a zygospore in a zygosporangium. Ascomycota (sac fungi) form spores in sacs called asci during sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction is their most common form of reproduction. In the Basidiomycota (club fungi), the sexual phase predominates, producing showy fruiting bodies that contain club-shaped basidia, within which spores form. Most familiar mushrooms belong to this division. Fungi that have no known sexual cycle were originally classified in the “form phylum” Deuteromycota, but many have been classified by comparative molecular analysis with the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Glomeromycota form tight associations (called mycorrhizae) with the roots of plants.</para></section>
