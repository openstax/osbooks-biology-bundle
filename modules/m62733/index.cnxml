<para id="fs-id1167066822348">Proteins are long chains of different sequences of the 20 amino acids that each contain an amino group (-NH<sub>2</sub>), a carboxyl group (-COOH), and a variable group. (Think of how many protein “words” can be made with 20 amino acid “letters”). Each amino acid is linked to its neighbor by a peptide bond formed by a dehydration reaction. A long chain of amino acids is known as a polypeptide. Proteins serve many functions in cells. They act as enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions, provide structural support, regulate the passage of substances across the cell membrane, protect against disease, and coordinate cell signaling pathways. Protein structure is organized at four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. The primary structure is the unique sequence of amino acids. A change in just one amino acid can change protein structure and function. For example, sickle cell anemia results from just one amino acid substitution in a hemoglobin molecule consisting of 574 amino acids. The secondary structure consists of the local folding of the polypeptide by hydrogen bond formation; leading to the α helix and β pleated sheet conformations. In the tertiary structure, various interactions, e.g., hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, disulfide linkages, and hydrophobic interactions between R groups, contribute to the folding of the polypeptide into different three-dimensional configurations. Most enzymes are of tertiary configuration. If a protein is denatured, loses its three-dimensional shape, it may no longer be functional. Environmental conditions such as temperature and pH can denature proteins. Some proteins, such as hemoglobin, are formed from several polypeptides, and the interactions of these subunits form the quaternary structure of proteins.</para>

Note that not all enzymes work under the same conditions. Amylase only works in an alkaline medium, such as in saliva, while pepsin works in the acid environment of the stomach. Discuss other materials that can be carried by protein in body fluids in addition to the substances listed for transport in the text.  Proteins also carry insoluble lipids in the body and transport charged ions, such as calcium, magnesium, and zinc. Discuss another important structural protein, collagen, as it is found throughout the body, including in most connective tissues.

<para id="fs-id1167067104735">Protein structure is explained as though it occurs in three to four discrete steps. In reality, the structural changes that result in a functional protein occur on a continuum. As the primary structure is formed off the ribosomes, the polypeptide chain goes through changes until the final configuration is achieved. Have the students imagine a strand of spaghetti as it cooks in a clear pot. Initially, the strand is straight (ignore the stiffness for this example). While it cooks, the strand will bend and twist and (again, for this example), fold itself into a loose ball made up of the strand of pasta. The resulting strand has a particular shape. Ask the students what types of chemical bonds or forces might affect protein structure. These shapes are dictated by the position of amino acids along the strand. Other forces will complete the folding and maintain the structure.</para>

Proteins may be structural, regulatory, contractile, or protective; they may serve in transport, storage, or membranes; or they may be toxins or enzymes. Each cell in a living system may contain thousands of proteins, each with a unique function. Their structures, like their functions, vary greatly. They are all, however, polymers of amino acids, arranged in a linear sequence.</para>
<para id="fs-id2862975"><term id="term-00002">Enzymes</term>, which are produced by living cells, are catalysts in biochemical reactions (like digestion) and are usually complex or conjugated proteins. Each enzyme is specific for the substrate (a reactant that binds to an enzyme) it acts on. The enzyme may help in breakdown, rearrangement, or synthesis reactions. Enzymes that break down their substrates are called catabolic enzymes, enzymes that build more complex molecules from their substrates are called anabolic enzymes, and enzymes that affect the rate of reaction are called catalytic enzymes. It should be noted that all enzymes increase the rate of reaction and, therefore, are considered to be organic catalysts. An example of an enzyme is salivary amylase, which hydrolyzes its substrate amylose, a component of starch.</para>

Because this essential protein’s role in producing cellular energy is crucial, it has changed very little over millions of years. Protein sequencing has shown that there is a considerable amount of cytochrome c amino acid sequence homology among different species; in other words, evolutionary kinship can be assessed by measuring the similarities or differences among various species’ DNA or protein sequences.</para>

For each cytochrome c molecule from different organisms that has been sequenced to date, 37 of these amino acids appear in the same position in all samples of cytochrome c. This indicates that there may have been a common ancestor. On comparing the human and chimpanzee protein sequences, no sequence difference was found. When human and rhesus monkey sequences were compared, the single difference found was in one amino acid. In another comparison, human to yeast sequencing shows a difference in the 44th position.</para>

This structure is in part due to chemical interactions at work on the polypeptide chain. Primarily, the interactions among R groups creates the complex three-dimensional tertiary structure of a protein. The nature of the R groups found in the amino acids involved can counteract the formation of the hydrogen bonds described for standard secondary structures. For example, R groups with like charges are repelled by each other and those with unlike charges are attracted to each other (ionic bonds). When protein folding takes place, the hydrophobic R groups of nonpolar amino acids lie in the interior of the protein, whereas the hydrophilic R groups lie on the outside. The former types of interactions are also known as hydrophobic interactions. Interaction between cysteine side chains forms disulfide linkages in the presence of oxygen, the only covalent bond forming during protein folding.</para><figure id="fs-id1167067006971" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch03-s04-lo03 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch03-s04-aplo-4-1"><media id="fs-id2336596" alt="This illustration shows a polypeptide backbone folded into a three-dimensional structure.

<title>Denaturation and Protein Folding</title>
<para id="fs-id2216009">Each protein has its own unique sequence and shape that are held together by chemical interactions. If the protein is subject to changes in temperature, changes in pH, or exposure to chemicals, the protein structure may change, losing its shape without losing its primary sequence in what is known as denaturation. Denaturation is often reversible because the primary structure of the polypeptide is conserved in the process if the denaturing agent is removed, allowing the protein to resume its function. Sometimes denaturation is irreversible, leading to loss of function. One example of irreversible protein denaturation is when an egg is fried. The albumin protein in the liquid egg white is denatured when placed in a hot pan. Not all proteins are denatured at high temperatures; for instance, bacteria that survive in hot springs have proteins that function at temperatures close to boiling. The stomach is also very acidic, has a low pH, and denatures proteins as part of the digestion process; however, the digestive enzymes of the stomach retain their activity under these conditions.</para><para id="fs-id1958698">Protein folding is critical to its function. It was originally thought that the proteins themselves were responsible for the folding process. Only recently was it found that often they receive assistance in the folding process from protein helpers known as <term id="term-00013">chaperones</term> (or chaperonins) that associate with the target protein during the folding process. They act by preventing aggregation of polypeptides that make up the complete protein structure, and they disassociate from the protein once the target protein is folded.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-id2335363">Proteins are a class of macromolecules that perform a diverse range of functions for the cell. They help in metabolism by providing structural support and by acting as enzymes, carriers, or hormones. The building blocks of proteins (monomers) are amino acids. Each amino acid has a central carbon that is linked to an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and an R group or side chain. There are 20 commonly occurring amino acids, each of which differs in the R group. Each amino acid is linked to its neighbors by a peptide bond. A long chain of amino acids is known as a polypeptide.</para>
<para id="fs-id2199492">Proteins are organized at four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and (optional) quaternary. The primary structure is the unique sequence of amino acids. The local folding of the polypeptide to form structures such as the <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis> helix and <emphasis effect="italics">β</emphasis>-pleated sheet constitutes the secondary structure. The overall three-dimensional structure is the tertiary structure. When two or more polypeptides combine to form the complete protein structure, the configuration is known as the quaternary structure of a protein. Protein shape and function are intricately linked; any change in shape caused by changes in temperature or pH may lead to protein denaturation and a loss in function.</para>

<para id="fs-id1166165881124">The properties of proteins are determined by interactions among the amino acids in the peptide-bonded chain. The protein subcomponents, especially amino R (variable) groups, can interact with very strong charge-charge forces, with attractive forces between groups of atoms with opposite polarities and with repulsive forces between groups of atoms with the same or no polarity. Attractive polar forces often arise between molecules through interactions between oxygen and hydrogen atoms or between nitrogen and hydrogen atoms.</para>
