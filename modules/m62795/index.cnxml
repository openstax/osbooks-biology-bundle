Embedded in the thylakoid membranes are two photosystems (PS I and PS II), which are complexes of pigments that capture solar energy. Chlorophylls <emphasis effect="italics">a</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">b</emphasis> absorb violet, blue, and red wavelengths from the visible light spectrum and reflect green. The carotenoid pigments absorb violet-blue-green light and reflect yellow-to-orange light. Environmental factors such as day length and temperature influence which pigments predominant at certain times of the year. Although the two photosystems run simultaneously, it is easier to explore them separately. Let’s begin with photosystem II.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167064710379" class="ost-reading-discard">A photon of light strikes the antenna pigments of PS II to initiate photosynthesis. In the noncyclic pathway, PS II captures photons at a slightly higher energy level than PS I. (Remember that shorter wavelengths of light carry more energy.) The absorbed energy travels to the reaction center of the antenna pigment that contains chlorophyll <emphasis effect="italics">a</emphasis> and boosts chlorophyll <emphasis effect="italics">a</emphasis> electrons to a higher energy level. The electrons are accepted by a primary electron acceptor protein and then pass to the electron transport chain also embedded in the thylakoid membrane. The energy absorbed in PS II is enough to oxidize (split) water, releasing oxygen into the atmosphere; the electrons released from the oxidation of water replace the electrons that were boosted from the reaction center chlorophyll. As the electrons from the reaction center chlorophyll pass through the series of electron carrier proteins, hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) are pumped across the membrane via chemiosmosis into the interior of the thylakoid. (If this sounds familiar, it should. We studied chemiosmosis in our exploration of cellular respiration in Cellular Respiration.) This action builds up a high concentration of H+ ions, and as they flow through ATP synthase, molecules of ATP are formed. These molecules of ATP will be used to provide free energy for the synthesis of carbohydrate in the Calvin cycle, the second stage of photosynthesis. The electron transport chain connects PS II and PS I. Similar to the events occurring in PS II, this second photosystem absorbs a second photon of light, resulting in the formation of a molecule of NADPH from NADP<sub>+</sub>. The energy carried in NADPH also is used to power the chemical reactions of the Calvin cycle.</para><para id="fs-id1167065655008" class="ost-reading-discard">Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and learning objectives outlined in Big Idea 2 of the AP<sup>®</sup> Biology Curriculum Framework, as shown in the table.

Humans can see only a fraction of this energy, which portion is therefore referred to as “visible light.” The manner in which solar energy travels is described as waves. Scientists can determine the amount of energy of a wave by measuring its <term id="term-00001">wavelength</term>, the distance between consecutive points of a wave.

<para id="fs-idm268137472">Light energy initiates the process of photosynthesis when pigments absorb the light. Organic pigments, whether in the human retina or the chloroplast thylakoid, have a narrow range of energy levels that they can absorb. Energy levels lower than those represented by red light are insufficient to raise an orbital electron to a populatable, excited (quantum) state. Energy levels higher than those in blue light will physically tear the molecules apart, called bleaching. So retinal pigments can only “see” (absorb) 700 nm to 400 nm light, which is therefore called visible light. For the same reasons, plants pigment molecules absorb only light in the wavelength range of 700 nm to 400 nm; plant physiologists refer to this range for plants as photosynthetically active radiation.</para>

Certain objects, such as a prism or a drop of water, disperse white light to reveal the colors to the human eye.

The carotenoids found in fruit—such as the red of tomato (lycopene), the yellow of corn seeds (zeaxanthin), or the orange of an orange peel (β-carotene)—are used as advertisements to attract seed dispersers. In photosynthesis, <term id="term-00005">carotenoids</term> function as photosynthetic pigments that are very efficient molecules for the disposal of excess energy. When a leaf is exposed to full sun, the light-dependent reactions are required to process an enormous amount of energy; if that energy is not handled properly, it can do significant damage. Therefore, many carotenoids reside in the thylakoid membrane, absorb excess energy, and safely dissipate that energy as heat.</para>

<para id="fs-idm135716528">The reaction center contains a pair of chlorophyll <emphasis effect="italics">a</emphasis> molecules with a special property. Those two chlorophylls can undergo oxidation upon excitation; they can actually give up an electron in a process called a <term id="term-00015">photoact</term>. It is at this step in the reaction center, this step in photosynthesis, that light energy is converted into an excited electron. All of the subsequent steps involve getting that electron onto the energy carrier NADPH for delivery to the Calvin cycle where the electron is deposited onto carbon for long-term storage in the form of a carbohydrate.PSII and PSI are two major components of the photosynthetic <term id="term-00016">electron transport chain</term>, which also includes the <term id="term-00017">cytochrome complex</term>. The cytochrome complex, an enzyme composed of two protein complexes, transfers the electrons from the carrier molecule plastoquinone (Pq) to the protein plastocyanin (Pc), thus enabling both the transfer of protons across the thylakoid membrane and the transfer of electrons from PSII to PSI.
</para><para id="fs-idm101449600">The reaction center of PSII (called <term id="term-00018">P680</term>) delivers its high-energy electrons, one at the time, to the <term id="term-00019">primary electron acceptor</term>, and through the electron transport chain (Pq to cytochrome complex to plastocyanine) to PSI. P680’s missing electron is replaced by extracting a low-energy electron from water; thus, water is split and PSII is re-reduced after every photoact. Splitting one H<sub>2</sub>O molecule releases two electrons, two hydrogen atoms, and one atom of oxygen. Splitting two molecules is required to form one molecule of diatomic O<sub>2</sub> gas. About 10 percent of the oxygen is used by mitochondria in the leaf to support oxidative phosphorylation. The remainder escapes to the atmosphere where it is used by aerobic organisms to support respiration.</para><para id="fs-idm16256512">As electrons move through the proteins that reside between PSII and PSI, they lose energy. That energy is used to move hydrogen atoms from the stromal side of the membrane to the thylakoid lumen. Those hydrogen atoms, plus the ones produced by splitting water, accumulate in the thylakoid lumen and will be used to synthesize ATP in a later step. Because the electrons have lost energy prior to their arrival at PSI, they must be re-energized by PSI, hence, another photon is absorbed by the PSI antenna. That energy is relayed to the PSI reaction center (called <term id="term-00020">P700</term>). P700 is oxidized and sends a high-energy electron to NADP<sup>+</sup> to form NADPH. Thus, PSII captures the energy to create proton gradients to make ATP, and PSI captures the energy to reduce NADP<sup>+</sup> into NADPH. The two photosystems work in concert, in part, to guarantee that the production of NADPH will roughly equal the production of ATP. Other mechanisms exist to fine tune that ratio to exactly match the chloroplast’s constantly changing energy needs.</para>

<para id="fs-idm53562256">As in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria during cellular respiration, the buildup of hydrogen ions inside the thylakoid lumen creates a concentration gradient. The passive diffusion of hydrogen ions from high concentration (in the thylakoid lumen) to low concentration (in the stroma) is harnessed to create ATP, just as in the electron transport chain of cellular respiration. The ions build up energy because of diffusion and because they all have the same electrical charge, repelling each other.</para><para id="fs-idm115415664">To release this energy, hydrogen ions will rush through any opening, similar to water jetting through a hole in a dam. In the thylakoid, that opening is a passage through a specialized protein channel called the ATP synthase. The energy released by the hydrogen ion stream allows ATP synthase to attach a third phosphate group to ADP, which forms a molecule of ATP (<link target-id="fig-ch08_02_08"/>). The flow of hydrogen ions through ATP synthase is called chemiosmosis because the ions move from an area of high to an area of low concentration through a semi-permeable structure.</para>
