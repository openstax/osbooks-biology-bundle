<title>Connection for AP<sup>®</sup> Courses</title><para id="fs-id1167065899023">All organisms, from bacteria to complex animals, must be able to store, retrieve, and transmit genetic information to continue life. In later chapters, we will explore how a cell’s genetic information encoded in DNA, its genome, is replicated and passed to the next generation to direct the production of proteins, determining an organism’s traits. Prokaryotes have single circular chromosome of DNA, whereas eukaryotes have multiple, linear chromosomes composed of chromatin (DNA wrapped around a histone protein) surrounded by a nuclear membrane. Cell division involves both mitosis, the division of the chromosomes, and cytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm. Human somatic cells consist of 46 chromosomes—22 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes. Prior to mitosis, each chromosome is duplicated to ensure that daughter cells receive the full amount of hereditary material contributed by both parents. The total number of autosomal chromosomes is referred to as the diploid (2<emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis>) number. (In the next chapter, we will study meiosis, the second type of cell division in sexually reproducing organisms.)</para>

<para id="fs-id2023520">The continuity of life from one cell to another has its foundation in the reproduction of cells by way of the cell cycle. The cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events that describes the stages of a cell’s life from the division of a single parent cell to the production of two new daughter cells. The mechanisms involved in the cell cycle are highly regulated.</para><section id="fs-id1235767" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch10-s01-lo01 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch10-s01-aplo-3-1 ost-get-exercise">
<title>Genomic DNA</title>
<para id="fs-id2694648">Before discussing the steps a cell must undertake to replicate, a deeper understanding of the structure and function of a cell’s genetic information is necessary. A cell’s DNA, packaged as a double-stranded DNA molecule, is called its <term id="term-00001">genome</term>. In prokaryotes, the genome is composed of a single, double-stranded DNA molecule in the form of a loop or circle (<link target-id="fig-ch10_01_01"/>). The region in the cell containing this genetic material is called a nucleoid. Some prokaryotes also have smaller loops of DNA called plasmids that are not essential for normal growth.  Bacteria can exchange these plasmids with other bacteria, sometimes receiving beneficial new genes that the recipient can add to their chromosomal DNA. Antibiotic resistance is one trait that often spreads through a bacterial colony through plasmid exchange.</para>

<caption>There are 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes in a female human somatic cell. The condensed chromosomes are viewed within the nucleus (top), removed from a cell in mitosis and spread out on a slide (right), and artificially arranged according to length (left); an arrangement like this is called a karyotype. In this image, the chromosomes were exposed to fluorescent stains for differentiation of the different chromosomes. A method of staining called “chromosome painting” employs fluorescent dyes that highlight chromosomes in different colors. (credit: National Human Genome Project/NIH)</caption></figure><para id="fs-id1602689">Matched pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism are called <term id="term-00005">homologous</term> (“same knowledge”) <term id="term-00006">chromosomes</term>. Homologous chromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide segments called <term id="term-00007">genes</term> in exactly the same location, or <term id="term-00008">locus</term>. Genes, the functional units of chromosomes, determine specific characteristics by coding for specific proteins. Traits are the variations of those characteristics. For example, hair color is a characteristic with traits that are blonde, brown, or black.</para>
<para id="fs-id2048187">Each copy of a homologous pair of chromosomes originates from a different parent; therefore, the genes themselves are not identical. The variation of individuals within a species is due to the specific combination of the genes inherited from both parents. Even a slightly altered sequence of nucleotides within a gene can result in an alternative trait. For example, there are three possible gene sequences on the human chromosome that code for blood type: sequence A, sequence B, and sequence O. Because all diploid human cells have two copies of the chromosome that determines blood type, the blood type (the trait) is determined by which two versions of the marker gene are inherited. It is possible to have two copies of the same gene sequence on both homologous chromosomes, with one on each (for example, AA, BB, or OO), or two different sequences, such as AB.</para>
<para id="fs-id1727981">Minor variations of traits, such as blood type, eye color, and handedness, contribute to the natural variation found within a species. However, if the entire DNA sequence from any pair of human homologous chromosomes is compared, the difference is less than one percent. The sex chromosomes, X and Y, are the single exception to the rule of homologous chromosome uniformity: Other than a small amount of homology that is necessary to accurately produce gametes, the genes found on the X and Y chromosomes are different.</para>

<title>Eukaryotic Chromosomal Structure and Compaction</title>
<para id="fs-id2385346">If the DNA from all 46 chromosomes in a human cell nucleus was laid out end to end, it would measure approximately two meters; however, its diameter would be only 2 nm. Considering that the size of a typical human cell is about 10 µm (100,000 cells lined up to equal one meter), DNA must be tightly packaged to fit in the cell’s nucleus. At the same time, it must also be readily accessible for the genes to be expressed. During some stages of the cell cycle, the long strands of DNA are condensed into compact chromosomes. There are a number of ways that chromosomes are compacted.</para>
<para id="fs-id1393700">In the first level of compaction, short stretches of the DNA double helix wrap around a core of eight <term id="term-00009">histone proteins</term> at regular intervals along the entire length of the chromosome (<link target-id="fig-ch10_01_03"/>). The DNA-histone complex is part of the chromatin. Each beadlike histone-DNA complex is called a <term id="term-00010">nucleosome</term>, and DNA connecting the nucleosomes is called linker DNA. A DNA molecule in this form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones, and the beads are about 10 nm in diameter, in contrast with the 2-nm diameter of a DNA double helix. The next level of compaction occurs as the nucleosomes and the linker DNA between them are coiled into a 30-nm chromatin fiber. This coiling further shortens the chromosome so that it is now about 50 times shorter than the extended form. In the third level of packing, a variety of fibrous proteins is used to pack the chromatin. These fibrous proteins also ensure that each chromosome in a non-dividing cell occupies a particular area of the nucleus that does not overlap with that of any other chromosome (see the top image in <link target-id="fig-ch10_01_02"/>).</para><figure id="fig-ch10_01_03" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch10-s01-lo01 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch10-s01-aplo-3-1"><media id="fs-id2195071" alt="There are five levels of chromosome organization.
