<para id="fs-id2609938">If oxygen is available, aerobic respiration will go forward. In eukaryotic cells, the pyruvate molecules produced at the end of glycolysis are transported into the mitochondria, which are the sites of cellular respiration. There, pyruvate is transformed into an acetyl group that will be picked up and activated by a carrier compound called coenzyme A (CoA). The resulting compound is called <term id="term-00001">acetyl CoA</term>. CoA is derived from vitamin B5, pantothenic acid. Acetyl CoA can be used in a variety of ways by the cell, but its major function is to deliver the acetyl group derived from pyruvate to the next stage of the pathway in glucose catabolism.</para>

<title>Breakdown of Pyruvate</title>
      <para id="fs-id1640338">In order for pyruvate, the product of glycolysis, to enter the next pathway, it must undergo several changes. The conversion is a three-step process (<link target-id="fig-ch07_03_01"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1720364"><emphasis effect="bold">Step 1.</emphasis> A carboxyl group is removed from pyruvate, releasing a molecule of carbon dioxide into the surrounding medium. This reaction creates a two-carbon hydroxyethyl group bound to the enzyme (pyruvate dehydrogenase). We should note that this is the first of the six carbons from the original glucose molecule to be removed. (This step proceeds twice because there are <emphasis effect="italics">two</emphasis> pyruvate molecules produced at the end of glycolsis for every molecule of glucose metabolized anaerobically; thus, two of the six carbons will have been removed at the end of both steps.)</para>

<title>Acetyl CoA to CO<sub>2</sub></title>
<para id="fs-id2186668">In the presence of oxygen, acetyl CoA delivers its acetyl (2C) group to a four-carbon molecule, oxaloacetate, to form citrate, a six-carbon molecule with three carboxyl groups; this pathway will harvest the remainder of the extractable energy from what began as a glucose molecule and release the remaining four CO<sub>2</sub> molecules. This single pathway is called by different names: the <term id="term-00002">citric acid cycle</term> (for the first intermediate formed—citric acid, or citrate—when acetate joins to the oxaloacetate), the <term id="term-00003">TCA cycle</term> (because citric acid or citrate and isocitrate are tricarboxylic acids), and the <term id="term-00004">Krebs cycle</term>, after Hans Krebs, who first identified the steps in the pathway in the 1930s in pigeon flight muscles.</para>

<title>Citric Acid Cycle</title>
      <para id="fs-id2750537">Like the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, the citric acid cycle takes place in the matrix of mitochondria. Almost all of the enzymes of the citric acid cycle are soluble, with the single exception of the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase, which is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Unlike glycolysis, the citric acid cycle is a closed loop: the last part of the pathway regenerates the compound used in the first step. The eight steps of the cycle are a series of redox, dehydration, hydration, and decarboxylation reactions that produce two carbon dioxide molecules, one GTP/ATP, and the reduced carriers NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> (<link target-id="fig-ch07_03_02"/>). <emphasis effect="italics">This is considered an aerobic pathway because the NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> produced must transfer their electrons to the next pathway in the system, which will use oxygen.</emphasis> If this transfer does not occur, the oxidation steps of the citric acid cycle also do not occur. Note that the citric acid cycle produces very little ATP directly and does not directly consume oxygen.</para>

In the first step, the acetyl group from acetyl uppercase C lower case o upper case A is transferred to a four-carbon oxaloacetate molecule to form a six-carbon citrate molecule.

<caption>In the citric acid cycle, the acetyl group from acetyl CoA is attached to a four-carbon oxaloacetate molecule to form a six-carbon citrate molecule. Through a series of steps, citrate is oxidized, releasing two carbon dioxide molecules for each acetyl group fed into the cycle. In the process, three NAD<sup>+</sup> molecules are reduced to NADH, one FAD molecule is reduced to FADH<sub>2</sub>, and one ATP or GTP (depending on the cell type) is produced (by substrate-level phosphorylation). Because the final product of the citric acid cycle is also the first reactant, the cycle runs continuously in the presence of sufficient reactants.

<title>Steps in the Citric Acid Cycle</title>
<para id="fs-id2319045"><emphasis effect="bold">Step 1</emphasis>. Prior to the first step, a transitional phase occurs during which pyruvic acid is converted to acetyl CoA. Then, the first step of the cycle begins: This condensation step combines the two-carbon acetyl group with a four-carbon oxaloacetate molecule to form a six-carbon molecule of citrate. CoA is bound to a sulfhydryl group (-SH) and diffuses away to eventually combine with another acetyl group. This step is irreversible because it is highly exergonic. The rate of this reaction is controlled by negative feedback and the amount of ATP available. If ATP levels increase, the rate of this reaction decreases. If ATP is in short supply, the rate increases.</para>
<para id="fs-id1420226"><emphasis effect="bold">Step 2</emphasis>. In step two, citrate loses one water molecule and gains another as citrate is converted into its isomer, isocitrate.</para>
<para id="fs-id2854030"><emphasis effect="bold">Step 3</emphasis>. In step three, isocitrate is oxidized, producing a five-carbon molecule, α-ketoglutarate, along with a molecule of CO<sub>2</sub> and two electrons, which reduce NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH. This step is also regulated by negative feedback from ATP and NADH and a positive effect of ADP.</para><para id="fs-id1227579"><emphasis effect="bold">Step 4.</emphasis> Steps three and four are both oxidation and decarboxylation steps, which as we have seen, release electrons that reduce NAD<sup>+ </sup>to NADH and release carboxyl groups that form CO<sub>2</sub> molecules. Alpha-ketoglutarate is the product of step three, and a succinyl group is the product of step four. CoA binds with the succinyl group to form succinyl CoA. The enzyme that catalyzes step four is regulated by feedback inhibition of ATP, succinyl CoA, and NADH.</para>
<para id="fs-id1702798"><emphasis effect="bold">Step 5</emphasis>. In step five, a carboxyl group is substituted for coenzyme A, and a high-energy bond is formed. This energy is used in substrate-level phosphorylation (during the conversion of the succinyl group to succinate) to form either guanosine triphosphate (GTP) or ATP. There are two forms of the enzyme, called isoenzymes, for this step, depending upon the type of animal tissue in which they are found. One form is found in tissues that use large amounts of ATP, such as heart and skeletal muscle. This form produces ATP. The second form of the enzyme is found in tissues that have a high number of anabolic pathways, such as liver. This form produces GTP. GTP is energetically equivalent to ATP; however, its use is more restricted. In particular, protein synthesis primarily uses GTP.</para>
<para id="fs-id1447483"><emphasis effect="bold">Step 6</emphasis>. Step six is a dehydrogenation process that converts succinate into fumarate. Two hydrogen atoms are transferred to FAD, reducing it to FADH<sub>2</sub>. (Note: the energy contained in the electrons of these hydrogens is insufficient to reduce NAD<sup>+</sup> but adequate to reduce FAD.) Unlike NADH, this carrier remains attached to the enzyme and transfers the electrons to the electron transport chain directly. This process is made possible by the localization of the enzyme catalyzing this step inside the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.</para>
<para id="fs-id1582545"><emphasis effect="bold">Step 7</emphasis>. Water is added by hydration to fumarate during step seven, and malate is produced. The last step in the citric acid cycle regenerates oxaloacetate by oxidizing malate. Another molecule of NADH is then produced in the process.</para>

<title>Products of the Citric Acid Cycle</title>
<para id="fs-id2135056">Two carbon atoms come into the citric acid cycle from each acetyl group, representing four out of the six carbons of one glucose molecule. Two carbon dioxide molecules are released on each turn of the cycle; however, these do not necessarily contain the most recently added carbon atoms. The two acetyl carbon atoms will eventually be released on later turns of the cycle; thus, all six carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are eventually incorporated into carbon dioxide. Each turn of the cycle forms three NADH molecules and one FADH<sub>2</sub> molecule. These carriers will connect with the last portion of aerobic respiration, the electron transport chain, to produce ATP molecules. One GTP or ATP is also made in each cycle. Several of the intermediate compounds in the citric acid cycle can be used in synthesizing nonessential amino acids; therefore, the cycle is <term id="term-00005">amphibolic</term> (both catabolic and anabolic).</para>

      <title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-id2018930">In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate is transformed into an acetyl group attached to a carrier molecule of coenzyme A. The resulting acetyl CoA can enter several pathways, but most often, the acetyl group is delivered to the citric acid cycle for further catabolism. During the conversion of pyruvate into the acetyl group, a molecule of carbon dioxide and two high-energy electrons are removed. The carbon dioxide accounts for two (conversion of two pyruvate molecules) of the six carbons of the original glucose molecule. The electrons are picked up by NAD<sup>+</sup>, and the NADH carries the electrons to a later pathway for ATP production. At this point, the glucose molecule that originally entered cellular respiration has been completely oxidized. Chemical potential energy stored within the glucose molecule has been transferred to electron carriers or has been used to synthesize a few ATPs.</para><para id="fs-id1770098">The citric acid cycle is a series of redox and decarboxylation reactions that removes high-energy electrons and carbon dioxide. The electrons, temporarily stored in molecules of NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>, are used to generate ATP in a subsequent pathway. One molecule of either GTP or ATP is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation on each turn of the cycle. There is no comparison of the cyclic pathway with a linear one.</para>
