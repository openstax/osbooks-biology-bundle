<title>Connection for AP<sup>®</sup> Courses</title><para id="fs-id1167066803741">Today the three letters “DNA” have become synonymous with crime solving, paternity testing, human identification, and genetic testing. All of these procedures are possible because of the discovery, in the middle of the twentieth century, that DNA is the genetic material. The results of several classic experiments set the stage for an explosion of our knowledge about DNA and how it stores and transmits genetic information. DNA was first isolated from white blood cells by Miescher in the 1860s.  Over fifty years later, Griffith’s work transforming strains of the bacterium <emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</emphasis> provided the first clue that DNA and not protein (as others argued) is the universal molecule of heredity. Griffith’s conclusions were later supported by Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167063563219">Subsequent experiments by Hershey and Chase using the bacteriophage T2 proved decisively that DNA is the genetic material. Shortly thereafter, Chargaff determined the ratios of adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine in DNA, suggesting paired relationships (A = T and C = G). He also found that the percentages of A, T, C, and G are different for different species. All of these historically important experiments shaped our current understanding of DNA.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167067311315">Stress to students that while DNA was discovered in the 1860s, the understanding that DNA is the genetic material came only in the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Prior to that time, most scientists thought that genetic information was transmitted by proteins. There were good reasons for this belief. Scientists had observed that there were many more proteins in cells than there were DNA molecules. They also observed that the chromosomes in eukaryotic cells were packed with large protein complexes. Today scientists call those chromosomal protein complexes histones. Histones play no role in transmitting genetic information. Instead, they help package and order the chromosomes in a cell’s nucleus.</para>

    <para id="fs-id1511467">Modern understandings of DNA have evolved from the discovery of nucleic acid to the development of the double-helix model. In the 1860s, Friedrich Miescher (<link target-id="fig-ch14_01_01"/>), a physician by profession, was the first person to isolate phosphate-rich chemicals from white blood cells or leukocytes. He named these chemicals (which would eventually be known as RNA and DNA) nuclein because they were isolated from the nuclei of the cells.</para>

<para id="fs-id1430986">A half century later, British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith was perhaps the first person to show that hereditary information could be transferred from one cell to another “horizontally,” rather than by descent. In 1928, he reported the first demonstration of bacterial <term id="term-00001">transformation</term>, a process in which external DNA is taken up by a cell, thereby changing morphology and physiology. He was working with <emphasis effect="italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae,</emphasis> the bacterium that causes pneumonia. Griffith worked with two strains, rough (R) and smooth (S). The R strain is non-pathogenic (does not cause disease) and is called rough because its outer surface is a cell wall and lacks a capsule; as a result, the cell surface appears uneven under the microscope. The S strain is pathogenic (disease-causing) and has a capsule outside its cell wall. As a result, it has a smooth appearance under the microscope. Griffith injected the live R strain into mice and they survived. In another experiment, when he injected mice with the heat-killed S strain, they also survived. In a third set of experiments, a mixture of live R strain and heat-killed S strain were injected into mice, and—to his surprise—the mice died. Upon isolating the live bacteria from the dead mouse, only the S strain of bacteria was recovered. When this isolated S strain was injected into fresh mice, the mice died. Griffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain into the live R strain and transformed it into the pathogenic S strain, and he called this the transforming principle (<link target-id="fig-ch14_01_02"/>). These experiments are now famously known as Griffith's transformation experiments.</para>

<caption>Two strains of <emphasis effect="italics">S. pneumoniae</emphasis> were used in Griffith’s transformation experiments. The R strain is non-pathogenic. The S strain is pathogenic and causes death. When Griffith injected a mouse with the heat-killed S strain and a live R strain, the mouse died. The S strain was recovered from the dead mouse. Thus, Griffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain to the R strain, transforming the R strain into S strain in the process. (credit "living mouse": modification of work by NIH; credit "dead mouse": modification of work by Sarah Marriage)</caption></figure><para id="fs-id2890946">Scientists Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty (1944) were interested in exploring this transforming principle further. They isolated the S strain from the dead mice and isolated the proteins and nucleic acids, namely RNA and DNA, as these were possible candidates for the molecule of heredity. They conducted a systematic elimination study. They used enzymes that specifically degraded each component and then used each mixture separately to transform the R strain. They found that when DNA was degraded, the resulting mixture was no longer able to transform the bacteria, whereas all of the other combinations were able to transform the bacteria. This led them to conclude that DNA was the transforming principle.</para>

<para id="fs-id2115765">DNA evidence was used for the first time to solve an immigration case. The story started with a teenage boy returning to London from Ghana to be with his mother. Immigration authorities at the airport were suspicious of him, thinking that he was traveling on a forged passport. After much persuasion, he was allowed to go live with his mother, but the immigration authorities did not drop the case against him. All types of evidence, including photographs, were provided to the authorities, but deportation proceedings were started nevertheless. Around the same time, Dr. Alec Jeffreys of Leicester University in the United Kingdom had invented a technique known as DNA fingerprinting. The immigration authorities approached Dr. Jeffreys for help. He took DNA samples from the mother and three of her children, plus an unrelated mother, and compared the samples with the boy’s DNA. Because the biological father was not in the picture, DNA from the three children was compared with the boy’s DNA. He found a match in the boy’s DNA for both the mother and his three siblings. He concluded that the boy was indeed the mother’s son.</para>
<para id="fs-id1227579">Forensic scientists analyze many items, including documents, handwriting, firearms, and biological samples. They analyze the DNA content of hair, semen, saliva, and blood, and compare it with a database of DNA profiles of known criminals. Analysis includes DNA isolation, sequencing, and sequence analysis; most forensic DNA analysis involves polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of short tandem repeat (STR) loci and electrophoresis to determine the length of the PCR-amplified fragment. Also, mitochondrial DNA is sequenced for forensics. Forensic scientists are expected to appear at court hearings to present their findings. They are usually employed in crime labs of city and state government agencies. Geneticists experimenting with DNA techniques also work for scientific and research organizations, pharmaceutical industries, and college and university labs. Students wishing to pursue a career as a forensic scientist should have at least a bachelor's degree in chemistry, biology, or physics, and preferably some experience working in a laboratory.</para></note>

<note id="fs-id1167066029974"><title>Answer:</title>Hershey and Chase used radioactive sulfur because sulfur is not found in DNA but is present in T2’s protein coat. They used radioactive phosphorus because phosphorus is not found in protein but is present in DNA. When they observed the infected bacterial cells they found them to contain radioactive phosphorus but no radioactive sulfur. Therefore, Hershey and Chase knew that the DNA was the infectious agent and, thus, the transmitter of genetic information.</note>
</note>


<para id="fs-id2025461">Experiments conducted by Martha Chase and Alfred Hershey in 1952 provided confirmatory evidence that DNA was the genetic material and not proteins. Chase and Hershey were studying a bacteriophage, which is a virus that infects bacteria. Viruses typically have a simple structure: a protein coat, called the capsid, and a nucleic acid core that contains the genetic material, either DNA or RNA. The bacteriophage infects the host bacterial cell by attaching to its surface, and then it injects its nucleic acids inside the cell. The phage DNA makes multiple copies of itself using the host machinery, and eventually the host cell bursts, releasing a large number of bacteriophages. Hershey and Chase labeled one batch of phage with radioactive sulfur, <sup>35</sup>S, to label the protein coat. Another batch of phage were labeled with radioactive phosphorus, <sup>32</sup>P. Because phosphorous is found in DNA, but not protein, the DNA and not the protein would be tagged with radioactive phosphorus.</para>
    <para id="fs-id1352111">Each batch of phage was allowed to infect the cells separately. After infection, the phage bacterial suspension was put in a blender, which caused the phage coat to be detached from the host cell. The phage and bacterial suspension was spun down in a centrifuge. The heavier bacterial cells settled down and formed a pellet, whereas the lighter phage particles stayed in the supernatant. In the tube that contained phage labeled with<sup> 35</sup>S, the supernatant contained the radioactively labeled phage, whereas no radioactivity was detected in the pellet. In the tube that contained the phage labeled with <sup>32</sup>P, the radioactivity was detected in the pellet that contained the heavier bacterial cells, and no radioactivity was detected in the supernatant.  Hershey and Chase concluded that it was the phage DNA that was injected
into the cell and carried information to produce more phage particles, thus providing evidence that DNA was the genetic material and not proteins (<link target-id="fig-ch14_01_03"/>).</para><figure id="fig-ch14_01_03" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch14-s01-lo02 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch14-s01-aplo-3-1 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch14-s01-aplo-3-2"><media id="fs-id1879663" alt="Illustration shows bacteria being infected by phage labeled with ^{35}S, which is incorporated into the protein coat, or ^{32}P, which is incorporated into the DNA.

<caption>In Hershey and Chase's experiments, bacteria were infected with phage radiolabeled with either <sup>35</sup>S, which labels protein, or <sup>32</sup>P, which labels DNA.

He found that the amount of adenine equals the amount of thymine, and the amount of cytosine equals the amount of guanine, or A = T and G = C. This is also known as Chargaff’s rules. This finding proved immensely useful when Watson and Crick were getting ready to propose their DNA double helix model.</para>

<problem id="fs-id1164968876503">
<para id="fs-id1164966584824">The proof that DNA, not protein, is the carrier of genetic information involved a number of historical experiments, including transformation or horizontal gene transfer (HGT), which is the uptake and expression of extracellular DNA.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164968588582">A. As described in Figure 14.3, transformation or HGT was first reported by Griffith in 1928 in an experiment in which the following occurred:</para>
<list id="fs-id1164961815624" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic" mark-suffix=")">
<item>heat-treated, pathogenic bacteria recovered their pathogenicity when incubated with nonpathogenic bacteria</item>
<item>plasmids were transferred to nonpathogenic bacteria from pathogenic bacteria through conjugation</item>
<item>nonpathogenic bacteria acquired pathogenicity when incubated in a broth containing heat-treated, pathogenic bacteria</item>
<item>polysaccharide cell capsules from pathogenic bacteria were transferred to nonpathogenic bacteria</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-id1164968598335">B. Griffiths experiment, however, left undetermined the identity of the cellular component that encoded genetic information.  The identity of DNA as the carrier of genetic information was resolved through the experiments by Martha Chase and Alfred Hershey because they observed the following:</para>
<list id="fs-id1164968587558" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic" mark-suffix=")">
<item>injections with a serum containing chemically isolated polysaccharides and nonpathogenic bacteria were not lethal</item>
<item>pathogenic bacterial DNA that was radioactively labeled using a phosphorus isotope was not present in mice that died</item>
<item>bacteriophages from a bacterial culture grown in a nutrient-containing medium and radioactively labeled using a sulfur isotope transferred the label to bacteria incubated in an unlabeled nutrient-containing medium </item>
<item>bacteriophages from a bacterial culture grown in a nutrient-containing medium and radioactively labeled using a sulfur isotope did not transfer the label to bacteria incubated in an unlabeled nutrient-containing medium </item>
</list>
<para id="fs-id1164966543240">C. Transformation and transduction increase variation within populations of bacteria and archaebacteria by the following:</para>
<list id="fs-id1164966282226" list-type="enumerated" number-style="lower-alpha">
<item>transferring DNA among different species</item>
<item>transferring free DNA across the cell membrane without energy expenditure</item>
<item>transferring DNA between different strains of the same species of bacteria </item>
<item>phagocytosis of bacteriophages</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-id1164966503323">The evolution of antibiotic resistance via HGT poses a challenge to medical technology.  On the other hand, transformation is often assayed by incorporating an antibiotic-resistance gene in the plasmid to be transferred into the host organism.  In natural environments, bacterial and archaebacterial cells become competent (able to transport DNA through the cytoplasmic membrane) in response to stress such as UV radiation, high population density, or heat shock.  Such conditions are often difficult to model in the laboratory, where competence can be induced by high concentrations of divalent cations, Ca<sup>+2</sup> or Mg<sup>+2</sup>, or electrical shock.  In either setting, extracellular DNA can be transported into the cell, and (to a good approximation) uptake is proportional to the concentration of extracellular DNA.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164961826900">D. <emphasis>Identify</emphasis> a factor that might affect transformation or HGT.  Then, <emphasis>design a plan</emphasis> to evaluate the dependence of transformational efficiency (defined as the number of transformations per gram of extracellular DNA) of plasmids that transfer antibiotic resistance to a particular strain of <emphasis effect="italics">Escherichia coli</emphasis> that is not resistant on that factor.</para>
