<title> Population Growth</title>
<para id="fs-idm76342192">The two simplest models of population growth use deterministic equations (equations that do not account for random events) to describe the rate of change in the size of a population over time. The first of these models, exponential growth, describes theoretical populations that increase in numbers without any limits to their growth. The second model, logistic growth, introduces limits to reproductive growth that become more intense as the population size increases. Neither model adequately describes natural populations, but they provide points of comparison.</para>
<section id="fs-idp113776032">
<title>Exponential Growth</title>
<para id="fs-idp75549024">Charles Darwin, in his theory of natural selection, was greatly influenced by the English clergyman Thomas Malthus. Malthus published a book in 1798 stating that populations with unlimited natural resources grow very rapidly, which represents an <term id="term-00001">exponential growth</term>, and then population growth decreases as resources become depleted, indicating a logistic growth.</para><para id="fs-idp40874352">The best example of exponential growth in organisms is seen in bacteria. Bacteria are prokaryotes that reproduce largely by binary fission. This division takes about an hour for many bacterial species. If 1000 bacteria are placed in a large flask with an abundant supply of nutrients (so the nutrients will not become quickly depleted), the number of bacteria will have doubled from 1000 to 2000 after just an hour. In another hour, each of the 2000 bacteria will divide, producing 4000 bacteria. After the third hour, there should be 8000 bacteria in the flask. The important concept of exponential growth is that the growth rate—the number of organisms added in each reproductive generation—is itself increasing; that is, the population size is increasing at a greater and greater rate. After 24 of these cycles, the population would have increased from 1000 to more than 16 billion bacteria. When the population size, <emphasis effect="italics">N</emphasis>, is plotted over time, a <term id="term-00002">J-shaped growth curve</term> is produced (<link target-id="fig-ch19_02_01"/><emphasis effect="bold">a</emphasis>).</para>
<para id="fs-idm55406096">The bacteria-in-a-flask example is not truly representative of the real world where resources are usually limited. However, when a species is introduced into a new habitat that it finds suitable, it may show exponential growth for a while. In the case of the bacteria in the flask, some bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce; therefore, the growth rate is lowered from a maximal rate in which there is no mortality. The growth rate of a population is largely determined by subtracting the <term id="term-00003">death rate</term>, <emphasis effect="italics">D</emphasis>, (number organisms that die during an interval) from the <term id="term-00004">birth rate</term>, <emphasis effect="italics">B</emphasis>, (number organisms that are born during an interval). The growth rate can be expressed in a simple equation that combines the birth and death rates into a single factor: <emphasis effect="italics">r</emphasis>. This is shown in the following formula:</para>

<title>Logistic Growth</title>
<para id="fs-idm89244144">Extended exponential growth is possible only when infinite natural resources are available; this is not the case in the real world. Charles Darwin recognized this fact in his description of the “struggle for existence,” which states that individuals will compete (with members of their own or other species) for limited resources. The successful ones are more likely to survive and pass on the traits that made them successful to the next generation at a greater rate (natural selection). To model the reality of limited resources, population ecologists developed the <term id="term-00006">logistic growth</term> model.</para>
<section id="fs-idm33759984">
<title>Carrying Capacity and the Logistic Model</title>
<para id="fs-idp78257440">In the real world, with its limited resources, exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely. Exponential growth may occur in environments where there are few individuals and plentiful resources, but when the number of individuals gets large enough, resources will be depleted and the growth rate will slow down. Eventually, the growth rate will plateau or level off (<link target-id="fig-ch19_02_01"/><emphasis effect="bold">b</emphasis>). This population size, which is determined by the maximum population size that a particular environment can sustain, is called the <term id="term-00007">carrying capacity</term>, or <emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis>. In real populations, a growing population often overshoots its carrying capacity, and the death rate increases beyond the birth rate causing the population size to decline back to the carrying capacity or below it. Most populations usually fluctuate around the carrying capacity in an undulating fashion rather than existing right at it.</para>
<para id="fs-idm47112576">The formula used to calculate logistic growth adds the carrying capacity as a moderating force in the growth rate. The expression “<emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis> – <emphasis effect="italics">N</emphasis>” is equal to the number of individuals that may be added to a population at a given time, and “<emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis> – <emphasis effect="italics">N</emphasis>” divided by “<emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis>” is the fraction of the carrying capacity available for further growth. Thus, the exponential growth model is restricted by this factor to generate the logistic growth equation:</para>

A graph of this equation (logistic growth) yields the <term id="term-00008">S-shaped curve</term> (<link target-id="fig-ch19_02_01"/><emphasis effect="bold">b</emphasis>). It is a more realistic model of population growth than exponential growth. There are three different sections to an S-shaped curve. Initially, growth is exponential because there are few individuals and ample resources available. Then, as resources begin to become limited, the growth rate decreases. Finally, the growth rate levels off at the carrying capacity of the environment, with little change in population number over time.</para>

<title>Role of Intraspecific Competition</title>
<para id="fs-idm57933760">The logistic model assumes that every individual within a population will have equal access to resources and, thus, an equal chance for survival. For plants, the amount of water, sunlight, nutrients, and space to grow are the important resources, whereas in animals, important resources include food, water, shelter, nesting space, and mates.</para>
<para id="fs-idm125320576">In the real world, phenotypic variation among individuals within a population means that some individuals will be better adapted to their environment than others. The resulting competition for resources among population members of the same species is termed <term id="term-00009">intraspecific competition</term>. Intraspecific competition may not affect populations that are well below their carrying capacity, as resources are plentiful and all individuals can obtain what they need. However, as population size increases, this competition intensifies. In addition, the accumulation of waste products can reduce carrying capacity in an environment.</para>

<title>Examples of Logistic Growth</title>

Its growth levels off as the population depletes the nutrients that are necessary for its growth. In the real world, however, there are variations to this idealized curve. Examples in wild populations include sheep and harbor seals (<link target-id="fig-ch19_02_02"/><emphasis effect="bold">b</emphasis>). In both examples, the population size exceeds the carrying capacity for short periods of time and then falls below the carrying capacity afterwards. This fluctuation in population size continues to occur as the population oscillates around its carrying capacity. Still, even with this oscillation, the logistic model is confirmed.</para>

<title> Population Dynamics and Regulation</title>
<para id="fs-idp115703536">The logistic model of population growth, while valid in many natural populations and a useful model, is a simplification of real-world population dynamics. Implicit in the model is that the carrying capacity of the environment does not change, which is not the case. The carrying capacity varies annually. For example, some summers are hot and dry whereas others are cold and wet; in many areas, the carrying capacity during the winter is much lower than it is during the summer. Also, natural events such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and fires can alter an environment and hence its carrying capacity. Additionally, populations do not usually exist in isolation. They share the environment with other species, competing with them for the same resources (interspecific competition). These factors are also important to understanding how a specific population will grow.</para>
<para id="fs-idm33450352">Population growth is regulated in a variety of ways. These are grouped into <term id="term-00010">density-dependent</term> factors, in which the density of the population affects growth rate and mortality, and <term id="term-00011">density-independent</term> factors, which cause mortality in a population regardless of population density. Wildlife biologists, in particular, want to understand both types because this helps them manage populations and prevent extinction or overpopulation.</para>
</section>
<section id="fs-idm75750048">
<title>Density-dependent Regulation</title>
<para id="fs-idp11625008">Most density-dependent factors are biological in nature and include predation, inter- and intraspecific competition, and parasites. Usually, the denser a population is, the greater its mortality rate. For example, during intra- and interspecific competition, the reproductive rates of the species will usually be lower, reducing their populations’ rate of growth. In addition, low prey density increases the mortality of its predator because it has more difficulty locating its food source. Also, when the population is denser, diseases spread more rapidly among the members of the population, which affect the mortality rate.</para>
<para id="fs-idm188329392">Density dependent regulation was studied in a natural experiment with wild donkey populations on two sites in Australia.<footnote id="fs-idp107489968">David Choquenot, “Density-Dependent Growth, Body Condition, and Demography in Feral Donkeys: Testing the Food Hypothesis,” <emphasis effect="italics">Ecology</emphasis> 72, no. 3 (June 1991):805–813.</footnote> On one site the population was reduced by a population control program; the population on the other site received no interference. The high-density plot was twice as dense as the low-density plot. From 1986 to 1987 the high-density plot saw no change in donkey density, while the low-density plot saw an increase in donkey density. The difference in the growth rates of the two populations was caused by mortality, not by a difference in birth rates. The researchers found that numbers of offspring birthed by each mother was unaffected by density. Growth rates in the two populations were different mostly because of juvenile mortality caused by the mother’s malnutrition due to scarce high-quality food in the dense population. <link target-id="fig-ch19_02_03"/> shows the difference in age-specific mortalities in the two populations.</para>

The mortality rate for the low-density population starts at about 0.2 at age 0 (near birth) then drops to about 0.06 at six months old, then gradually climbs only a small amount to reach about 0.1 at the age of 10.5 years.">

<section id="fs-idm66235504"><title>Density-independent Regulation and Interaction with Density-dependent Factors</title><para id="fs-idm108102448">Many factors that are typically physical in nature cause mortality of a population regardless of its density. These factors include weather, natural disasters, and pollution. An individual deer will be killed in a forest fire regardless of how many deer happen to be in that area. Its chances of survival are the same whether the population density is high or low. The same holds true for cold winter weather.</para>
<para id="fs-idp28263328">In real-life situations, population regulation is very complicated and density-dependent and independent factors can interact. A dense population that suffers mortality from a density-independent cause will be able to recover differently than a sparse population. For example, a population of deer affected by a harsh winter will recover faster if there are more deer remaining to reproduce.</para>

<para id="fs-idm112038064">In the first part of the curve, when few individuals of the species are present and resources are plentiful, growth is exponential, similar to a J-shaped curve. Later, growth slows due to the species using up resources. Finally, the population levels off at the carrying capacity of the environment, and it is relatively stable over time.</para>
