<title>Connection for AP<sup>®</sup> Courses</title><para id="fs-id1167067208854">The cell cycle describes an orderly sequence of events that are highly regulated. In eukaryotes, the cell cycle consists of a long preparatory period (interphase) followed by mitosis and cytokinesis. Interphase is divided into three phases: Gap 1 (G<sub>1</sub>), DNA synthesis (S), and Gap 2 (G<sub>2</sub>). Interphase represents the portion of the cell cycle between nuclear divisions. During this phase, preparations are made for division that include growth, duplication of most cellular contents, and replication of DNA. The cell’s DNA is replicated during the S stage. (We will study the details of DNA replication in the chapter on DNA structure and function.) Following the G<sub>2</sub> stage of interphase, the cell begins mitosis, the process of active division by which duplicated chromosomes (chromatids) attach to spindle fibers, align themselves along the equator of the cell, and then separate from each other.</para><para id="fs-id1167066958074">Following mitosis, the cell undergoes cytokinesis, the splitting of the parent cell into two daughter cells, complete with a full complement of genetic material. In animal cells, daughter cells are separated by an actin ring, whereas plant cells are separated by the cell plate, which will grow into a new cell wall. Sometimes cells enter a Gap zero (G<sub>0</sub>) phase, during which they do not actively prepare to divide; the G<sub>0</sub> phase can be temporary until triggered by an external signal to enter G<sub>1</sub>, or permanent, such as mature cardiac muscle cells and nerve cells.</para>

The proteins of the kinetochore attract and bind mitotic spindle microtubules. As the spindle microtubules extend from the centrosomes, some of these microtubules come into contact with and firmly bind to the kinetochores. Once a mitotic fiber attaches to a chromosome, the chromosome will be oriented until the kinetochores of sister chromatids face the opposite poles. Eventually, all the sister chromatids will be attached via their kinetochores to microtubules from opposing poles. Spindle microtubules that do not engage the chromosomes are called polar microtubules. These microtubules overlap each other midway between the two poles and contribute to cell elongation. Astral microtubules are located near the poles, aid in spindle orientation, and are required for the regulation of mitosis.</para>

Division is not complete until the cell components have been apportioned and completely separated into the two daughter cells. Although the stages of mitosis are similar for most eukaryotes, the process of cytokinesis is quite different for eukaryotes that have cell walls, such as plant cells. </para><para id="fs-id2199309">In cells such as animal cells that lack cell walls, cytokinesis starts during late anaphase. A contractile ring composed of actin filaments forms just inside the plasma membrane at the former metaphase plate. The actin filaments pull the equator of the cell inward, forming a fissure. This fissure, or “crack,” is called the <term id="term-00020">cleavage furrow</term>. The furrow deepens as the actin ring contracts, and eventually the membrane is cleaved in two (<link target-id="fig-ch10_02_04" document=""/>).</para><para id="fs-id1466552">In plant cells, a new cell wall must form between the daughter cells. During interphase, the Golgi apparatus accumulates enzymes, structural proteins, and glucose molecules prior to breaking into vesicles and dispersing throughout the dividing cell. During telophase, these Golgi vesicles are transported on microtubules to form a phragmoplast (a vesicular structure) at the metaphase plate. There, the vesicles fuse and coalesce from the center toward the cell walls; this structure is called a <term id="term-00021">cell plate</term>. As more vesicles fuse, the cell plate enlarges until it merges with the cell walls at the periphery of the cell. Enzymes use the glucose that has accumulated between the membrane layers to build a new cell wall. The Golgi membranes become parts of the plasma membrane on either side of the new cell wall (<link target-id="fig-ch10_02_04" document=""/>).</para>

A variety of materials can be used to represent chromosomes in the model as long as the students can easily distinguish between the three chromosomes (such as by having different-sized pipe cleaners) as well as distinguish between homologs (such as by using two colors of pipe cleaner). Be sure to provide enough chromosomes to represent sister chromatids in both the mitosis and meiosis models. The critical point to stress is that, in modelling mitosis, students should place homologous chromosomes (each with a sister chromatid) above and below each other during metaphase, ensuring a sister chromosome from each homolog enters each daughter cell. Conversely, in metaphase I of meiosis, the homologous chromosomes (each with a sister chromatid) will pair together side-by-side so that each cell only receives one of the two homologs.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-id1519661">The cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events. Cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages. In eukaryotes, the cell cycle consists of a long preparatory period, called interphase. Interphase is divided into G<sub>1</sub>, S, and G<sub>2</sub> phases. The mitotic phase begins with karyokinesis (mitosis), which consists of five stages: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The final stage of the mitotic phase is cytokinesis, during which the cytoplasmic components of the daughter cells are separated either by an actin ring (animal cells) or by cell plate formation (plant cells).</para>
