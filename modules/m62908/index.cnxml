<para id="fs-id1167065857031">Plants have specialized leaves adapted to their particular environments. For example, the leaves of plants growing in tropical rainforests have a larger surface area than cacti growing in the desert or in very cold conditions, whose smaller surface area minimizes water loss through transpiration. A waxy <emphasis>cuticle</emphasis> covers the surface of all plant species to reduce the rate of water loss from the leaf surface. Other leaves may have small hairs called trichomes on the leaf surface; not only do trichomes also help reduce water loss; they also protect the leaf from herbivory by restricting insect movements or by storing toxic or bad-tasting chemicals.</para>

<para id="fs-idm15905472">Leaves are the main sites for photosynthesis: the process by which plants synthesize food. Most leaves are usually green, due to the presence of chlorophyll in the leaf cells. However, some leaves may have different colors, caused by other plant pigments that mask the green chlorophyll.</para>
<para id="fs-idp62105632">The thickness, shape, and size of leaves are adapted to the environment. Each variation helps a plant species maximize its chances of survival in a particular habitat. Usually, the leaves of plants growing in tropical rainforests have larger surface areas than those of plants growing in deserts or very cold conditions, which are likely to have a smaller surface area to minimize water loss.</para>

<title>Structure of a Typical Leaf</title>
<para id="fs-idm15231104">Each leaf typically has a leaf blade called the <emphasis>lamina</emphasis>, which is also the widest part of the leaf. Some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a <emphasis>petiole</emphasis>. Leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called <emphasis>sessile</emphasis> leaves. Small green appendages usually found at the base of the petiole are known as <emphasis>stipules</emphasis>. Most leaves have a midrib, which travels the length of the leaf and branches to each side to produce veins of vascular tissue. The edge of the leaf is called the margin. <link target-id="fig-ch30_04_01"/> shows the structure of a typical eudicot leaf.</para>

Monocots have parallel venation; the veins run in straight lines across the length of the leaf without converging at a point. In dicots, however, the veins of the leaf have a net-like appearance, forming a pattern known as reticulate venation.

<title>Leaf Arrangement</title>
<para id="fs-idp41592528">The arrangement of leaves on a stem is known as <emphasis>phyllotaxy</emphasis>. The number and placement of a plant’s leaves will vary depending on the species, with each species exhibiting a characteristic leaf arrangement. Leaves are classified as either alternate, spiral, or opposite. Plants that have only one leaf per node have leaves that are said to be either alternate—meaning the leaves alternate on each side of the stem in a flat plane—or spiral, meaning the leaves are arrayed in a spiral along the stem. In an opposite leaf arrangement, two leaves arise at the same point, with the leaves connecting opposite each other along the branch. If there are three or more leaves connected at a node, the leaf arrangement is classified as <emphasis>whorled</emphasis>.</para>

In a <emphasis>compound leaf</emphasis>, the leaf blade is completely divided, forming leaflets, as in the locust tree. Each leaflet may have its own stalk, but is attached to the rachis. A <emphasis>palmately compound leaf</emphasis> resembles the palm of a hand, with leaflets radiating outwards from one point Examples include the leaves of poison ivy, the buckeye tree, or the familiar houseplant <emphasis effect="italics">Schefflera</emphasis> sp.

<title>Leaf Structure and Function</title>
<para id="fs-idp143575408">The outermost layer of the leaf is the epidermis; it is present on both sides of the leaf and is called the upper and lower epidermis, respectively. Botanists call the upper side the adaxial surface (or adaxis) and the lower side the abaxial surface (or abaxis). The epidermis helps in the regulation of gas exchange. It contains stomata (<link target-id="fig-ch30_04_04"/>): openings through which the exchange of gases takes place. Two guard cells surround each stoma, regulating its opening and closing.</para>

A waxy layer known as the cuticle covers the leaves of all plant species. The cuticle reduces the rate of water loss from the leaf surface. Other leaves may have small hairs (trichomes) on the leaf surface. Trichomes help to deter herbivory by restricting insect movements, or by storing toxic or bad-tasting compounds; they can also reduce the rate of transpiration by blocking air flow across the leaf surface (<link target-id="fig-ch30_04_05"/>).</para>

The palisade parenchyma (also called the palisade mesophyll) has column-shaped, tightly packed cells, and may be present in one, two, or three layers. Below the palisade parenchyma are loosely arranged cells of an irregular shape. These are the cells of the spongy parenchyma (or spongy mesophyll). The air space found between the spongy parenchyma cells allows gaseous exchange between the leaf and the outside atmosphere through the stomata. In aquatic plants, the intercellular spaces in the spongy parenchyma help the leaf float. Both layers of the mesophyll contain many chloroplasts. Guard cells are the only epidermal cells to contain chloroplasts.</para>

<para id="fs-idp22057728">Roots, stems, and leaves are structured to ensure that a plant can obtain the required sunlight, water, soil nutrients, and oxygen resources. Some remarkable adaptations have evolved to enable plant species to thrive in less than ideal habitats, where one or more of these resources is in short supply.</para>
<para id="fs-idp67065024">In tropical rainforests, light is often scarce, since many trees and plants grow close together and block much of the sunlight from reaching the forest floor. Many tropical plant species have exceptionally broad leaves to maximize the capture of sunlight. Other species are epiphytes: plants that grow on other plants that serve as a physical support. Such plants are able to grow high up in the canopy atop the branches of other trees, where sunlight is more plentiful. Epiphytes live on rain and minerals collected in the branches and leaves of the supporting plant. Bromeliads (members of the pineapple family), ferns, and orchids are examples of tropical epiphytes (<link target-id="fig-ch30_04_08"/>). Many epiphytes have specialized tissues that enable them to efficiently capture and store water.</para>

Carnivorous plants, such as the Venus flytrap and the pitcher plant (<link target-id="fig-ch30_04_09"/>), grow in bogs where the soil is low in nitrogen. In these plants, leaves are modified to capture insects. The insect-capturing leaves may have evolved to provide these plants with a supplementary source of much-needed nitrogen.</para>

Trees such as mangroves (<emphasis effect="italics">Rhizophora </emphasis>sp.) growing in coastal waters produce aboveground roots that help support the tree (<link target-id="fig-ch30_04_10"/>). Some species of mangroves, as well as cypress trees, have pneumatophores: upward-growing roots containing pores and pockets of tissue specialized for gas exchange. Wild rice is an aquatic plant with large air spaces in the root cortex. The air-filled tissue—called aerenchyma—provides a path for oxygen to diffuse down to the root tips, which are embedded in oxygen-poor bottom sediments.</para>
