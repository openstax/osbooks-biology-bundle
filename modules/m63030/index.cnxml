<para id="fs-idm126310480">Although life histories describe the way many characteristics of a population (such as their age structure) change over time in a general way, population ecologists make use of a variety of methods to model population dynamics mathematically. These more precise models can then be used to accurately describe changes occurring in a population and better predict future changes. Certain models that have been accepted for decades are now being modified or even abandoned due to their lack of predictive ability, and scholars strive to create effective new models.</para>

<title>Exponential Growth</title>
<para id="fs-idm142026480">Charles Darwin, in his theory of natural selection, was greatly influenced by the English clergyman Thomas Malthus. Malthus published a book in 1798 stating that populations with unlimited natural resources grow very rapidly, which represents an <term>exponential growth</term>, and then population growth decreases as resources become depleted, indicating a logistic growth.</para><para id="fs-idm256913536">The best example of exponential growth is seen in bacteria. Bacteria are prokaryotes that reproduce by prokaryotic fission. This division takes about an hour for many bacterial species. If 1000 bacteria are placed in a large flask with an unlimited supply of nutrients (so the nutrients will not become depleted), after an hour, there is one round of division and each organism divides, resulting in 2000 organisms—an increase of 1000. In another hour, each of the 2000 organisms will double, producing 4000, an increase of 2000 organisms. After the third hour, there should be 8000 bacteria in the flask, an increase of 4000 organisms. The important concept of exponential growth is that the <emphasis>population growth rate</emphasis>—the number of organisms added in each reproductive generation—is accelerating; that is, it is increasing at a greater and greater rate. After 1 day and 24 of these cycles, the population would have increased from 1000 to more than 16 billion. When the population size, <emphasis effect="italics">N</emphasis>, is plotted over time, a <emphasis>J-shaped growth curve</emphasis> is produced (<link target-id="fig-ch45_03_01" document=""/>).</para><para id="fs-idm137193024">The bacteria example is not representative of the real world where resources are limited. Furthermore, some bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce, lowering the growth rate. Therefore, when calculating the growth rate of a population, the <emphasis>death rate (<emphasis effect="italics">D</emphasis>)</emphasis> (number organisms that die during a particular time interval) is subtracted from the <emphasis>birth rate (<emphasis effect="italics">B</emphasis>)</emphasis> (number organisms that are born during that interval). This is shown in the following formula:</para>

<title>Logistic Growth</title>
<para id="fs-idm178752016">Exponential growth is possible only when infinite natural resources are available; this is not the case in the real world. Charles Darwin recognized this fact in his description of the “struggle for existence,” which states that individuals will compete (with members of their own or other species) for limited resources. The successful ones will survive to pass on their own characteristics and traits (which we know now are transferred by genes) to the next generation at a greater rate (natural selection). To model the reality of limited resources, population ecologists developed the <emphasis>logistic growth</emphasis> model.</para>
<section id="fs-idm262936464">
<title>Carrying Capacity and the Logistic Model</title>
<para id="fs-idm165983232">In the real world, with its limited resources, exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely. Exponential growth may occur in environments where there are few individuals and plentiful resources, but when the number of individuals gets large enough, resources will be depleted, slowing the growth rate. Eventually, the growth rate will plateau or level off (<link target-id="fig-ch45_03_01" document=""/>). This population size, which represents the maximum population size that a particular environment can support, is called the <emphasis>carrying capacity, or <emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis></emphasis>.</para><para id="fs-idp3422736">The formula we use to calculate logistic growth adds the carrying capacity as a moderating force in the growth rate. The expression “<emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis> – <emphasis effect="italics">N</emphasis>” is indicative of how many individuals may be added to a population at a given stage, and “<emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis> – <emphasis effect="italics">N</emphasis>” divided by “<emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis>” is the fraction of the carrying capacity available for further growth. Thus, the exponential growth model is restricted by this factor to generate the logistic growth equation:</para>

There are three different sections to an S-shaped curve. Initially, growth is exponential because there are few individuals and ample resources available. Then, as resources begin to become limited, the growth rate decreases. Finally, growth levels off at the carrying capacity of the environment, with little change in population size over time.</para></section>

<title>Role of Intraspecific Competition</title>
<para id="fs-idm37604320">The logistic model assumes that every individual within a population will have equal access to resources and, thus, an equal chance for survival. For plants, the amount of water, sunlight, nutrients, and the space to grow are the important resources, whereas in animals, important resources include food, water, shelter, nesting space, and mates.</para>
<para id="fs-idm178436096">In the real world, phenotypic variation among individuals within a population means that some individuals will be better adapted to their environment than others. The resulting competition between population members of the same species for resources is termed <emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis>intraspecific competition</emphasis> </emphasis>(intra- = “within”; -specific = “species”). Intraspecific competition for resources may not affect populations that are well below their carrying capacity—resources are plentiful and all individuals can obtain what they need. However, as population size increases, this competition intensifies. In addition, the accumulation of waste products can reduce an environment’s carrying capacity.</para>

<problem id="fs-idm176153584"><para id="fs-idm219011872">Describe the rate of population growth that would be expected at various parts of the S-shaped curve of logistic growth.</para></problem>

    <label/>
    <para id="fs-idm93193776">In the first part of the curve, when few individuals of the species are present and resources are plentiful, growth is exponential, similar to a J-shaped curve. Later, growth slows due to the species using up resources. Finally, the population levels off at the carrying capacity of the environment, and it is relatively stable over time.</para>
