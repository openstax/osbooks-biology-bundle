<para id="fs-id1808646">Biology is the science that studies life, but what exactly is life? This may sound like a silly question with an obvious response, but it is not always easy to define life. For example, a branch of biology called virology studies viruses, which exhibit some of the characteristics of living entities but lack others. Although viruses can attack living organisms, cause diseases, and even reproduce, they do not meet the criteria that biologists use to define life. Consequently, virologists are not biologists, strictly speaking. Similarly, some biologists study the early molecular evolution that gave rise to life. Since the events that preceded life are not biological events, these scientists are also excluded from biology in the strict sense of the term.</para>
<para id="fs-id2248548">From its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with three questions: What are the shared properties that make something “alive”? Once we know something is alive, how do we find meaningful levels of organization in its structure? Finally, when faced with the remarkable diversity of life, how do we organize the different kinds of organisms so that we can better understand them? As scientists discover new organisms every day, biologists continue to seek answers to these and other questions.</para>
<section id="fs-id1396394">
<title>Properties of Life</title>
<para id="fs-id2137494">All living organisms share several key characteristics or functions: order, sensitivity or response to the environment, reproduction, adaptation, growth and development, regulation/homeostasis, energy processing, and evolution. When viewed together, these eight characteristics serve to define life.</para><section id="fs-id2008387">

</figure>
<para id="fs-id1477381">Organisms are highly organized, coordinated structures that consist of one or more cells. Even very simple, single-celled organisms are remarkably complex: inside each cell, atoms form molecules. These in turn form cell organelles and other cellular inclusions. In multicellular organisms (<link target-id="fig-ch01_02_01"/>), similar cells form tissues. Tissues, in turn, collaborate to create organs (body structures with a distinct function). Organs work together to form organ systems.</para>

<para id="fs-id2144919">Organisms respond to diverse stimuli. For example, plants can bend toward a source of light, climb on fences and walls, or respond to touch (<link target-id="fig-ch01_02_02"/>). Even tiny bacteria can move toward or away from chemicals (a process called <emphasis effect="italics">chemotaxis</emphasis>) or light (<emphasis effect="italics">phototaxis</emphasis>). Movement toward a stimulus is a positive response, while movement away from a stimulus is a negative response.</para>

</note></section>
<section id="fs-id1794075">
<title>Reproduction</title>
<para id="fs-id1397107">Single-celled organisms reproduce by first duplicating their DNA, and then dividing it equally as the cell prepares to divide to form two new cells. Multicellular organisms often produce specialized reproductive cells—gametes and oocyte and sperm cells. After fertilization (the fusion of an oocyte and a sperm cell), a new individual develops. When reproduction occurs, DNA containing genes are passed along to an organism’s offspring. These genes ensure that the offspring will belong to the same species and will have similar characteristics, such as size and shape.</para>
</section>
<section id="adaptation"><title>Adaptation</title>
<para id="fit">All living organisms exhibit a “fit” to their environment. Biologists refer to this fit as adaptation, and it is a consequence of evolution by natural selection, which operates in every lineage of reproducing organisms. Examples of adaptations are diverse and unique, from heat-resistant Archaea that live in boiling hotsprings to the tongue length of a nectar-feeding moth that matches the size of the flower from which it feeds. Adaptations enhance the reproductive potential of the individuals exhibiting them, including their ability to survive to reproduce. Adaptations are not constant. As an environment changes, natural selection causes the characteristics of the individuals in a population to track those changes.</para></section>
<section id="fs-id2890560">
<title>Growth and Development</title>
<para id="fs-id1962069">Organisms grow and develop as a result of genes providing specific instructions that will direct cellular growth and development. This ensures that a species’ young (<link target-id="fig-ch01_02_03"/>) will grow up to exhibit many of the same characteristics as its parents.</para>

<title>Regulation/Homeostasis</title>
<para id="fs-id2195734">Even the smallest organisms are complex and require multiple regulatory mechanisms to coordinate internal functions, respond to stimuli, and cope with environmental stresses. <term id="term-00001">Homeostasis</term> (literally, “steady state”) refers to the relatively stable internal environment required to maintain life. Two examples of internal functions regulated in an organism are nutrient transport and blood flow. Organs (groups of tissues working together) perform specific functions, such as carrying oxygen throughout the body, removing wastes, delivering nutrients to every cell, and cooling the body.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch01_02_04"><media id="fs-id1582545" alt="A photos shows a white, furry polar bear.">

</figure>
<para id="fs-id2853902">In order to function properly, cells require appropriate conditions such as proper temperature, pH, and appropriate concentration of diverse chemicals. These conditions may, however, change from one moment to the next. Organisms are able to maintain homeostatic internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly, despite environmental changes, by activation of regulatory mechanisms. For example, an organism needs to regulate body temperature through the thermoregulation process. Organisms that live in cold climates, such as the polar bear (<link target-id="fig-ch01_02_04"/>), have body structures that help them withstand low temperatures and conserve body heat. Structures that aid in this type of insulation include fur, feathers, blubber, and fat. In hot climates, organisms have methods (such as perspiration in humans or panting in dogs) that help them to shed excess body heat.</para>

<title>Levels of Organization of Living Things</title>
<para id="fs-id1850530">Living things are highly organized and structured, following a hierarchy that we can examine on a scale from small to large. The <term id="term-00002">atom</term> is the smallest and most fundamental unit of matter  that retains the properties of an element. It consists of a nucleus surrounded by electrons. Atoms form molecules. A <term id="term-00003">molecule</term> is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds. Many molecules that are biologically important are <term id="term-00004">macromolecules</term>, large molecules that are typically formed by polymerization (a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers, which are simpler than macromolecules). An example of a macromolecule is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (<link target-id="fig-ch01_02_06"/>), which contains the instructions for the structure and functioning of all living organisms.</para>

</note>
<para id="fs-id2074834">Some cells contain aggregates of macromolecules surrounded by membranes. We call these <term id="term-00005">organelles</term>. Organelles are small structures that exist within cells. Examples of organelles include mitochondria and chloroplasts, which carry out indispensable functions: mitochondria produce energy to power the cell, while chloroplasts enable green plants to utilize the energy in sunlight to make sugars. All living things are made of cells. The <term id="term-00006">cell</term> itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms. (This requirement is why scientists do not consider viruses living: they are not made of cells. To make new viruses, they have to invade and hijack the reproductive mechanism of a living cell. Only then can they obtain the materials they need to reproduce.) Some organisms consist of a single cell and others are multicellular. Scientists classify cells as prokaryotic or eukaryotic. <term id="term-00007">Prokaryotes</term> are single-celled or colonial organisms that do not have membrane-bound nuclei. In contrast, the cells of <term id="term-00008">eukaryotes</term> do have membrane-bound organelles and a membrane-bound nucleus.</para>
<para id="fs-id2155753">In larger organisms, cells combine to make <term id="term-00009">tissues</term>, which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related functions. <term id="term-00010">Organs</term> are collections of tissues grouped together performing a common function. Organs are present not only in animals but also in plants. An <term id="term-00011">organ system</term> is a higher level of organization that consists of functionally related organs. Mammals have many organ systems. For instance, the circulatory system transports blood through the body and to and from the lungs. It includes organs such as the heart and blood vessels. <term id="term-00012">Organisms</term> are individual living entities. For example, each tree in a forest is an organism. Single-celled prokaryotes and single-celled eukaryotes are also organisms, which biologists typically call microorganisms.</para>
<para id="eip-622">Biologists collectively call all the individuals of a species living within a specific area a <term id="term-00013">population</term>. For example, a forest may include many pine trees, which represent the population of pine trees in this forest. Different populations may live in the same specific area. For example, the forest with the pine trees includes populations of flowering plants, insects, and microbial populations. A <term id="term-00014">community</term> is the sum of populations inhabiting a particular area. For instance, all of the trees, flowers, insects, and other populations in a forest form the forest’s community. The forest itself is an ecosystem. An <term id="term-00015">ecosystem</term> consists of all the living things in a particular area together with the abiotic, nonliving parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or rain water. At the highest level of organization (<link target-id="fig-ch01_02_07"/>), the <term id="term-00016">biosphere</term> is the collection of all ecosystems, and it represents the zones of life on Earth. It includes land, water, and even the atmosphere to a certain extent.</para>

<title>The Diversity of Life</title>
<para id="fs-id1957422">The fact that biology, as a science, has such a broad scope has to do with the tremendous diversity of life on earth. The source of this diversity is <term id="term-00017">evolution</term>, the process of gradual change in a population or species over time. Evolutionary biologists study the evolution of living things in everything from the microscopic world to ecosystems.</para><para id="fs-id2199492">A phylogenetic tree (<link target-id="fig-ch01_02_08"/>) can summarize the evolution of various life forms on Earth. It is a diagram showing the evolutionary relationships among biological species based on similarities and differences in genetic or physical traits or both. Nodes and branches comprise a phylogenetic tree. The internal nodes represent ancestors and are points in evolution when, based on scientific evidence, researchers believe an ancestor has diverged to form two new species. The length of each branch is proportional to the time elapsed since the split.</para>

</caption></figure><note id="fs-id2581806" class="evolution"><title>Carl Woese and the Phylogenetic Tree</title>
<para id="fs-id2024686">In the past, biologists grouped living organisms into five kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria. They based the organizational scheme mainly on physical features, as opposed to physiology, biochemistry, or molecular biology, all of which modern systematics use. American microbiologist Carl Woese's pioneering work in the early 1970s has shown, however, that life on Earth has evolved along three lineages, now called domains—Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The first two are prokaryotic cells with microbes that lack membrane-enclosed nuclei and organelles. The third domain contains the eukaryotes and includes unicellular microorganisms (protists), together with the three remaining kingdoms (fungi, plants, and animals). Woese defined Archaea as a new domain, and this resulted in a new taxonomic tree (<link target-id="fig-ch01_02_08"/>). Many organisms belonging to the Archaea domain live under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles. To construct his tree, Woese used genetic relationships rather than similarities based on morphology (shape).</para>
<para id="fs-id2956594">Woese constructed his tree from universally distributed comparative gene sequencing that are present in every organism, and conserved (meaning that these genes have remained essentially unchanged throughout evolution). Woese’s approach was revolutionary because comparing physical features are insufficient to differentiate between the prokaryotes that appear fairly similar in spite of their tremendous biochemical diversity and genetic variability (<link target-id="fig-ch01_02_09"/>). Comparing rRNA sequences provided Woese with a sensitive device that revealed the extensive variability of prokaryotes, and which justified separating the prokaryotes into two domains: bacteria and archaea.</para><figure id="fig-ch01_02_09" orient="vertical"><media id="eip-idp79648976" alt="There are four photos shown.

<title>Branches of Biological Study</title>
<para id="fs-id1908444">The scope of biology is broad and therefore contains many branches and subdisciplines. Biologists may pursue one of those subdisciplines and work in a more focused field. For instance, <term id="term-00018">molecular biology</term> and <term id="term-00019">biochemistry</term> study biological processes at the molecular and chemical level, including interactions among molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, as well as the way they are regulated. <term id="term-00020">Microbiology</term>, the study of microorganisms, is the study of the structure and function of single-celled organisms.

<para id="fs-id1808500">Forensic science is the application of science to answer questions related to the law. Biologists as well as chemists and biochemists can be forensic scientists. Forensic scientists provide scientific evidence for use in courts, and their job involves examining trace materials associated with crimes. Interest in forensic science has increased in the last few years, possibly because of popular television shows that feature forensic scientists on the job. Also, developing molecular techniques and establishing DNA databases have expanded the types of work that forensic scientists can do. Their job activities are primarily related to crimes against people such as murder, rape, and assault. Their work involves analyzing samples such as hair, blood, and other body fluids and also processing DNA (<link target-id="fig-ch01_02_10"/>) found in many different environments and materials. Forensic scientists also analyze other biological evidence left at crime scenes, such as insect larvae or pollen grains. Students who want to pursue careers in forensic science will most likely have to take chemistry and biology courses as well as some intensive math courses.</para>

<para id="fs-id2162573">Researchers can approach biology from the smallest to the largest, and everything in between. For instance, an ecologist may study a population of individuals, the population’s community, the community’s ecosystem, and the ecosystem’s part in the biosphere. When studying an individual organism, a biologist could examine the cell and its organelles, the tissues that the cells make up, the organs and their respective organ systems, and the sum total—the organism itself.</para></solution>
