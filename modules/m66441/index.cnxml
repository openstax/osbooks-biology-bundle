<para id="fs-id1318871"><term id="term-00001">Lipids</term> include a diverse group of compounds that are largely nonpolar in nature. This is because they are hydrocarbons that include mostly nonpolar carbon–carbon or carbon–hydrogen bonds. Non-polar molecules are hydrophobic (“water fearing”), or insoluble in water. Lipids perform many different functions in a cell. Cells store energy for long-term use in the form of fats. Lipids also provide insulation from the environment for plants and animals (<link target-id="fig-ch03_03_01"/>). For example, they help keep aquatic birds and mammals dry when forming a protective layer over fur or feathers because of their water-repellent hydrophobic nature. Lipids are also the building blocks of many hormones and are an important constituent of all cellular membranes. Lipids include fats, oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids.</para>

<title>Fats and Oils</title>
<para id="fs-id1671785">A fat molecule consists of two main components—glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol is an organic compound (alcohol) with three carbons, five hydrogens, and three hydroxyl (OH) groups. Fatty acids have a long chain of hydrocarbons to which a carboxyl group is attached, hence the name “fatty acid.” The number of carbons in the fatty acid may range from 4 to 36. The most common are those containing 12–18 carbons. In a fat molecule, the fatty acids attach to each of the glycerol molecule's three carbons with an ester bond through an oxygen atom (<link target-id="fig-ch03_03_02"/>).</para>
<figure id="fig-ch03_03_02" class="span-all"><media id="fs-id2569082" alt="The structures of glycerol, a fatty acid, and a triacylglycerol are shown. Glycerol is a chain of three carbons, with a hydroxyl (upper O upper H) group attached to each carbon. A fatty acid has an acetyl (upper C upper O upper O upper H) group attached to a long carbon chain. In triacylglycerol, a fatty acid is attached to each of glycerols three hydroxyl groups via the carboxyl group. A water molecule is lost in the reaction so the structure of the linkage is C dash O dash C, with an oxygen double bonded to the second carbon.">

<caption>Joining three fatty acids to a glycerol backbone in a dehydration reaction forms triacylglycerol. Three water molecules release in the process.</caption></figure><para id="fs-id1483230">During this ester bond formation, three water molecules are released. The three fatty acids in the triacylglycerol may be similar or dissimilar. We also call fats <term id="term-00002">triacylglycerols</term> or <term id="term-00003">triglycerides</term> because of their chemical structure. Some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin. For example, palmitic acid, a <term id="term-00004">saturated fatty acid</term>, is derived from the palm tree. Arachidic acid is derived from <emphasis effect="italics">Arachis hypogea,</emphasis> the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts.</para>
<para id="fs-id891930">Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. In a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds between neighboring carbons in the hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is saturated. Saturated fatty acids are saturated with hydrogen. In other words, the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized. Stearic acid is an example of a saturated fatty acid (<link target-id="fig-ch03_03_03"/>).</para>
<figure id="fig-ch03_03_03" class="span-all"><media id="fs-id1235407" alt="The structure of stearic acid is shown. This fatty acid has a hydrocarbon chain seventeen residues long attached to an acetyl group. All bonds between the carbons are single bonds.">

<caption>Stearic acid is a common saturated fatty acid.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-id2169828">When the hydrocarbon chain contains a double bond, the fatty acid is <term id="term-00005">unsaturated</term>. Oleic acid is an example of an unsaturated fatty acid (<link target-id="fig-ch03_03_04"/>).</para>
<figure id="fig-ch03_03_04" class="span-all"><media id="fs-id1807206" alt="The structure of oleic acid is shown. This fatty acid has a hydrocarbon chain seventeen residues long attached to an acetyl group. The bond between carbon eight and carbon nine is a double bond.">

</media>
<caption>Oleic acid is a common unsaturated fatty acid.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-id1797773">Most unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature. We call these oils. If there is one double bond in the molecule, then it is a monounsaturated fat (e.g., olive oil), and if there is more than one double bond, then it is a polyunsaturated fat (e.g., canola oil).</para>
<para id="fs-id1066559">When a fatty acid has no double bonds, it is a saturated fatty acid because it is not possible to add more hydrogen to the chain's carbon atoms. A fat may contain similar or different fatty acids attached to glycerol. Long straight fatty acids with single bonds generally pack tightly and are solid at room temperature. Animal fats with stearic acid and palmitic acid (common in meat) and the fat with butyric acid (common in butter) are examples of saturated fats. Mammals store fats in specialized cells, or adipocytes, where fat globules occupy most of the cell’s volume. Plants store fat or oil in many seeds and use them as a source of energy during seedling development. Unsaturated fats or oils are usually of plant origin and contain <emphasis effect="italics">cis</emphasis> unsaturated fatty acids. <emphasis effect="italics">Cis</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">trans</emphasis> indicate the configuration of the molecule around the double bond. If hydrogens are present in the same plane, it is a cis fat. If the hydrogen atoms are on two different planes, it is a <term id="term-00006">trans fat</term>. The <emphasis effect="italics">cis</emphasis> double bond causes a bend or a “kink” that prevents the fatty acids from packing tightly, keeping them liquid at room temperature (<link target-id="fig-ch03_03_05"/>). Olive oil, corn oil, canola oil, and cod liver oil are examples of unsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats help to lower blood cholesterol levels; whereas, saturated fats might contribute to plaque formation in the arteries.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch03_03_05" class="span-all"><media id="fs-id1415018" alt="A comparison of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids is shown. Stearic acid, a saturated fatty acid, has a hydrocarbon chain seventeen residues long attached to an acetyl group. Oleic acid also has a seventeen-residue hydrocarbon chain, but a double bond exists between the eighth and ninth carbon in the chain. In cis oleic acid, the hydrogens are on the same side of the double bond.  In the cis oleic acid, the 2 hydrogens on the same side cuase the chain to bend. In trans oleic acid, they are on opposite sides.">

<title>Trans Fats</title>
<para id="fs-id1236538">The food industry artificially hydrogenates oils to make them semi-solid and of a consistency desirable for many processed food products. Simply speaking, hydrogen gas is bubbled through oils to solidify them. During this hydrogenation process, double bonds of the <emphasis effect="italics">cis</emphasis>- conformation in the hydrocarbon chain may convert to double bonds in the <emphasis effect="italics">trans</emphasis>- conformation.</para>
<para id="fs-id1447736">Margarine, some types of peanut butter, and shortening are examples of artificially hydrogenated trans fats. Recent studies have shown that an increase in trans fats in the human diet may lead to higher levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), or “bad” cholesterol, which in turn may lead to plaque deposition in the arteries, resulting in heart disease. Many fast food restaurants have recently banned using trans fats, and food labels are required to display the trans fat content.</para>

<title>Omega Fatty Acids</title>
<para id="fs-id1958165">Essential fatty acids are those that the human body requires but does not synthesize. Consequently, they have to be supplemented through ingestion via the diet. <term id="term-00007">Omega</term>-3 fatty acids (like those in <link target-id="fig-ch03_03_06"/>) fall into this category and are one of only two known for humans (the other is omega-6 fatty acid). These are polyunsaturated fatty acids and are omega-3 because a double bond connects the third carbon from the hydrocarbon chain's end to its neighboring carbon.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch03_03_06">
<media id="fs-id2927265" alt="The molecular structures of alpha-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid is shown. Alpha-linolenic acid has three double bonds located eight, eleven, and fourteen residues from the acetyl group. It has a hooked shape.">
<image mime-type="image/jpg" src="../../media/Figure_03_03_07-cb9e.jpg" width="320"/>
</media>
<caption>Alpha-linolenic acid is an example of an omega-3 fatty acid. It has three <emphasis effect="italics">cis</emphasis> double bonds and, as a result, a curved shape. For clarity, the diagram does not show the carbons. Each singly bonded carbon has two hydrogens associated with it, which the diagram also does not show.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-id1768637">The farthest carbon away from the carboxyl group is numbered as the omega (<emphasis effect="italics">ω</emphasis>) carbon, and if the double bond is between the third and fourth carbon from that end, it is an omega-3 fatty acid. Nutritionally important because the body does not make them, omega-3 fatty acids include alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), all of which are polyunsaturated. Salmon, trout, and tuna are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Research indicates that omega-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of sudden death from heart attacks, lower triglycerides in the blood, decrease blood pressure, and prevent thrombosis by inhibiting blood clotting. They also reduce inflammation, and may help lower the risk of some cancers in animals.</para>
<para id="fs-id1966110">Like carbohydrates, fats have received considerable bad publicity. It is true that eating an excess of fried foods and other “fatty” foods leads to weight gain. However, fats do have important functions. Many vitamins are fat soluble, and fats serve as a long-term storage form of fatty acids: a source of energy. They also provide insulation for the body. Therefore, we should consume “healthy” fats in moderate amounts on a regular basis.</para>

Because of waxes' hydrophobic nature, they prevent water from sticking on the surface (<link target-id="fig-ch03_03_07"/>).

<title>Phospholipids</title>
<para id="fs-id2682552"><term id="term-00009">Phospholipids</term> are major plasma membrane constituents that comprise cells' outermost layer. Like fats, they are comprised of fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol or sphingosine backbone. However, instead of three fatty acids attached as in triglycerides, there are two fatty acids forming diacylglycerol, and a modified phosphate group occupies the glycerol backbone's third carbon (<link target-id="fig-ch03_03_08"/>). A phosphate group alone attached to a diacylglycerol does not qualify as a phospholipid. It is phosphatidate (diacylglycerol 3-phosphate), the precursor of phospholipids. An alcohol modifies the phosphate group. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine are two important phospholipids that are in plasma membranes.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch03_03_08"><media id="fs-id1442842" alt="The molecular structure of a phospholipid is shown. It consists of two fatty acids attached to the first and second carbons in glycerol, and a phosphate group attached to the third position. The phosphate group may be further modified by addition of another molecule to one of its oxygens. Two molecules that may modify the phosphate group, choline and serine, are shown. Choline consists of a two-carbon chain with a hydroxy group attached to one end and a nitrogen attached to the other. The nitrogen, in turn, has three methyl groups attached to it and has a charge of plus one. Serine consists of a two-carbon chain with a hydroxyl group attached to one end. An amino group and a carboxyl group are attached to the other end.">

<caption>A phospholipid is a molecule with two fatty acids and a modified phosphate group attached to a glycerol backbone. Adding a charged or polar chemical group may modify the phosphate.</caption></figure>
<para id="fs-id1953709">A phospholipid is an amphipathic molecule, meaning it has a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic part. The fatty acid chains are hydrophobic and cannot interact with water; whereas, the phosphate-containing group is hydrophilic and interacts with water (<link target-id="fig-ch03_03_09"/>).</para>

<title>Steroids</title>
<para id="fs-id1780762">Unlike the phospholipids and fats that we discussed earlier, <term id="term-00010">steroids</term> have a fused ring structure. Although they do not resemble the other lipids, scientists group them with them because they are also hydrophobic and insoluble in water. All steroids have four linked carbon rings and several of them, like cholesterol, have a short tail (<link target-id="fig-ch03_03_10"/>). Many steroids also have the –OH functional group, which puts them in the alcohol classification (sterols).</para>
<figure id="fig-ch03_03_10">
<media id="fs-id1685167" alt=" The structures of cholesterol and cortisol are shown. Each of these molecules is composed of three six-carbon rings fused to a five-carbon ring.

<para id="fs-id1473085">Cholesterol is the most common steroid. The liver synthesizes cholesterol and is the precursor to many steroid hormones such as testosterone and estradiol, which gonads and endocrine glands secrete. It is also the precursor to Vitamin D. Cholesterol is also the precursor of bile salts, which help emulsifying fats and their subsequent absorption by cells. Although lay people often speak negatively about cholesterol, it is necessary for the body's proper functioning. Sterols (cholesterol in animal cells, phytosterol in plants) are components of the plasma membrane of cells and are found within the phospholipid bilayer.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title>
<para id="fs-id2344871">Lipids are a class of macromolecules that are nonpolar and hydrophobic in nature. Major types include fats and oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. Fats are a stored form of energy and are also known as triacylglycerols or triglycerides. Fats are comprised of fatty acids and either glycerol or sphingosine. Fatty acids may be unsaturated or saturated, depending on the presence or absence of double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain. If only single bonds are present, they are saturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids may have one or more double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain. Phospholipids comprise the membrane's matrix. They have a glycerol or sphingosine backbone to which two fatty acid chains and a phosphate-containing group are attached. Steroids are another class of lipids. Their basic structure has four fused carbon rings. Cholesterol is a type of steroid and is an important constituent of the plasma membrane, where it helps to maintain the membrane's fluid nature. It is also the precursor of steroid hormones such as testosterone.</para>
