<para id="fs-id1167066999947">While looking at the logistic model is very useful when studying population dynamics, additional methods are used when considering more complex situations, such as changes in the carrying capacity of the environment. Abiotic and biotic factors can affect the growth and death rates of a population, so these fluctuations also require consideration when modeling a population’s change over time. Sometimes, scientists need to consider how reproductive strategies play a part into the dynamics of a population over time. To consider how these different factors interact, populations are looked at from a variety of perspectives.</para>

<para id="fs-idm41957168" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch36-s04-lo01">The logistic model of population growth, while valid in many natural populations and a useful model, is a simplification of real-world population dynamics. Implicit in the model is that the carrying capacity of the environment does not change, which is not the case. The carrying capacity varies annually: for example, some summers are hot and dry whereas others are cold and wet. In many areas, the carrying capacity during the winter is much lower than it is during the summer. Also, natural events such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and fires can alter an environment and hence its carrying capacity. Additionally, populations do not usually exist in isolation. They engage in <emphasis>interspecific competition</emphasis>: that is, they share the environment with other species, competing with them for the same resources. These factors are also important to understanding how a specific population will grow.</para>
<para id="fs-idm114798496">Nature regulates population growth in a variety of ways. These are grouped into <emphasis>density-dependent</emphasis> factors, in which the density of the population at a given time affects growth rate and mortality, and <emphasis>density-independent</emphasis> factors, which influence mortality in a population regardless of population density. Note that in the former, the effect of the factor on the population depends on the density of the population at onset. Conservation biologists want to understand both types because this helps them manage populations and prevent extinction or overpopulation.</para>

<title>Density-dependent Regulation</title>
<para id="fs-idm87430832">Most density-dependent factors are biological in nature (biotic), and include predation, inter- and intraspecific competition, accumulation of waste, and diseases such as those caused by parasites. Usually, the denser a population is, the greater its mortality rate. For example, during intra- and interspecific competition, the reproductive rates of the individuals will usually be lower, reducing their population’s rate of growth. In addition, low prey density increases the mortality of its predator because it has more difficulty locating its food source.</para>
<para id="fs-idm21187472">An example of density-dependent regulation is shown in <link target-id="fig-ch45_04_01"/> with results from a study focusing on the giant intestinal roundworm (<emphasis effect="italics">Ascaris lumbricoides</emphasis>), a parasite of humans and other mammals.<footnote id="fs-idm16051536">N.A.

One possible explanation for this is that females would be smaller in more dense populations (due to limited resources) and that smaller females would have fewer eggs. This hypothesis was tested and disproved in a 2009 study which showed that female weight had no influence.<footnote id="fs-idm92850624">Martin Walker et al., “Density-Dependent Effects on the Weight of Female <emphasis effect="italics">Ascaris lumbricoides</emphasis> Infections of Humans and its Impact on Patterns of Egg Production.” <emphasis effect="italics">Parasites &amp; Vectors</emphasis> 2, no. 11 (February 2009), doi:10.1186/1756-3305-2-11.</footnote> The actual cause of the density-dependence of fecundity in this organism is still unclear and awaiting further investigation.</para>

The regulation of population growth by these factors can be used to introduce a classical concept in population biology, that of <emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis>-selected versus <emphasis effect="italics">r</emphasis>-selected species.</para>
        <section id="fs-idm80927872">
            <title>Early Theories about Life History: <emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis>-selected and <emphasis effect="italics">r</emphasis>-selected Species</title>
            <para id="fs-idm74640608">By the second half of the twentieth century, the concept of K- and r-selected species was used extensively and successfully to study populations. The concept relates not only reproductive strategies, but also to a species’ habitat and behavior, especially in the way that they obtain resources and care for their young. It includes length of life and survivorship factors as well. For this analysis, population biologists have grouped species into the two large categories—<emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis>-selected and <emphasis effect="italics">r</emphasis>-selected—although they are really two ends of a continuum.</para>
            <para id="fs-idm76032816"><emphasis><emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis>-selected species</emphasis> are species selected by stable, predictable environments. Populations of <emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis>-selected species tend to exist close to their carrying capacity (hence the term <emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis>-selected) where intraspecific competition is high. These species have few, large offspring, a long gestation period, and often give long-term care to their offspring (Table B45_04_01). While larger in size when born, the offspring are relatively helpless and immature at birth. By the time they reach adulthood, they must develop skills to compete for natural resources. In plants, scientists think of parental care more broadly: how long fruit takes to develop or how long it remains on the plant are determining factors in the time to the next reproductive event. Examples of <emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis>-selected species are primates (including humans), elephants, and plants such as oak trees (<link target-id="fig-ch45_04_03"/><emphasis effect="bold">a</emphasis>).</para>
            <para id="fs-idm169833952">Oak trees grow very slowly and take, on average, 20 years to produce their first seeds, known as acorns. As many as 50,000 acorns can be produced by an individual tree, but the germination rate is low as many of these rot or are eaten by animals such as squirrels. In some years, oaks may produce an exceptionally large number of acorns, and these years may be on a two- or three-year cycle depending on the species of oak (<emphasis effect="italics">r</emphasis>-selection).</para>
            <para id="fs-idm30441648">As oak trees grow to a large size and for many years before they begin to produce acorns, they devote a large percentage of their energy budget to growth and maintenance. The tree’s height and size allow it to dominate other plants in the competition for sunlight, the oak’s primary energy resource. Furthermore, when it does reproduce, the oak produces large, energy-rich seeds that use their energy reserve to become quickly established (<emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis>-selection).</para>
            <para id="fs-idm115714080">In contrast, <emphasis><emphasis effect="italics">r</emphasis>-selected species</emphasis>  have a large number of small offspring (hence their <emphasis effect="italics">r</emphasis> designation (<link target-id="tab-ch45_04_01"/>). This strategy is often employed in unpredictable or changing environments. Animals that are <emphasis effect="italics">r</emphasis>-selected do not give long-term parental care and the offspring are relatively mature and self-sufficient at birth. Examples of <emphasis effect="italics">r</emphasis>-selected species are marine invertebrates, such as jellyfish, and plants, such as the dandelion (<link target-id="fig-ch45_04_03"/><emphasis effect="bold">b</emphasis>). Dandelions have small seeds that are wind dispersed long distances. Many seeds are produced simultaneously to ensure that at least some of them reach a hospitable environment. Seeds that land in inhospitable environments have little chance for survival since their seeds are low in energy content. Note that survival is not necessarily a function of energy stored in the seed itself.</para>

Furthermore, the theory ignored the age-specific mortality of the populations which scientists now know is very important. New <emphasis>demographic-based models</emphasis> of life history evolution have been developed which incorporate many ecological concepts included in <emphasis effect="italics">r</emphasis>- and <emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis>-selection theory as well as population age structure and mortality factors.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-idp26879408">Populations are regulated by a variety of density-dependent and density-independent factors. Species are divided into two categories based on a variety of features of their life history patterns: <emphasis effect="italics">r</emphasis>-selected species, which have large numbers of offspring, and <emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis>-selected species, which have few offspring. The <emphasis effect="italics">r</emphasis>- and <emphasis effect="italics">K</emphasis>-selection theory has fallen out of use; however, many of its key features are still used in newer, demographically-based models of population dynamics.</para>
