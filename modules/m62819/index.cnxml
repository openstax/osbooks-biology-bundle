<title>Connection for AP<sup>®</sup> Courses</title><para id="fs-id1167062305841" class="ost-reading-discard">As was described previously, Mendel proposed that genes are inherited as pairs of alleles that behave in a dominant and recessive pattern. During meiosis, alleles segregate, or separate, such that each gamete is equally likely to receive either one of the two alleles present in the diploid individual. Mendel called this phenomenon the law of segregation, which can be demonstrated in a monohybrid cross. In addition, genes carried on different chromosomes sort into gametes independently of one another. This is Mendel’s law of independent assortment. This law can be demonstrated in a dihybrid cross involving two different traits located on different chromosomes. Punnett squares can be used to predict genotypes and phenotypes of offspring involving one or two genes.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167066015213" class="ost-reading-discard">Although chromosomes sort independently into gametes during meiosis, Mendel’s law of independent assortment refers to genes, not chromosomes. In humans, single chromosomes may carry more than 1,000 genes. Genes located close together on the same chromosome are said to be linked genes. When genes are located in close proximity on the same chromosome, their alleles tend to be inherited together unless recombination occurs. This results in offspring ratios that violate Mendel’s law of independent assortment. Genes that are located far apart on the same chromosome are likely to assort independently. The rules of probability can help to sort this out (pun intended). The law states that alleles of different genes assort independently of one another during gamete formation.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167065744107">Emphasize that very few traits depend on a single genes. Multiallelic traits are much more common but are much more difficult to study because of the complexity of multi-gene interactions. Cite height, skin and eye pigmentation. Also introduce the concept of environmental effects on the expression of traits (i.e. nature versus nurture).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167064951700">A good example of environmental effect is the color of petals in hydrangeas. The enzyme that converts the pigment from pink to blue requires aluminum ions as cofactors. The uptake of aluminum ions is inhibited in neutral or alkaline soils, and the blooms appear pink. Gardeners can amend acidic soil with lime to neutralize the pH. The blooms will turn to pink once the soil reaches a neutral to alkaline pH.</para>

            <para id="fs-id1432196">Mendel’s <term id="term-00001">law of dominance</term> states that in a heterozygote, one trait will conceal the presence of another trait for the same characteristic. Rather than both alleles contributing to a phenotype, the dominant allele will be expressed exclusively. The recessive allele will remain “latent” but will be transmitted to offspring by the same manner in which the dominant allele is transmitted. The recessive trait will only be expressed by offspring that have two copies of this allele (<link target-id="fig-ch12_03_01"/>), and these offspring will breed true when self-crossed.</para>
            <para id="fs-id1790967">Since Mendel’s experiments with pea plants, other researchers have found that the law of dominance does not always hold true. Instead, several different patterns of inheritance have been found to exist.</para>

            <title>Equal Segregation of Alleles</title>
            <para id="fs-id2114874">Observing that true-breeding pea plants with contrasting traits gave rise to F<sub>1</sub> generations that all expressed the dominant trait and F<sub>2</sub> generations that expressed the dominant and recessive traits in a 3:1 ratio, Mendel proposed the <term id="term-00002">law of segregation</term>. This law states that paired unit factors (genes) must segregate equally into gametes such that offspring have an equal likelihood of inheriting either factor. For the F<sub>2</sub> generation of a monohybrid cross, the following three possible combinations of genotypes could result: homozygous dominant, heterozygous, or homozygous recessive. Because heterozygotes could arise from two different pathways (receiving one dominant and one recessive allele from either parent), and because heterozygotes and homozygous dominant individuals are phenotypically identical, the law supports Mendel’s observed 3:1 phenotypic ratio. The equal segregation of alleles is the reason we can apply the Punnett square to accurately predict the offspring of parents with known genotypes. The physical basis of Mendel’s law of segregation is the first division of meiosis, in which the homologous chromosomes with their different versions of each gene are segregated into daughter nuclei.  The role of the meiotic segregation of chromosomes in sexual reproduction was not understood by the scientific community during Mendel’s lifetime.</para>

</note><para id="fs-id1626327">For the F2 generation, the law of segregation requires that each gamete receive either an <emphasis effect="italics">R</emphasis> allele or an <emphasis effect="italics">r</emphasis> allele along with either a <emphasis effect="italics">Y</emphasis> allele or a <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis> allele. The law of independent assortment states that a gamete into which an <emphasis effect="italics">r</emphasis> allele sorted would be equally likely to contain either a <emphasis effect="italics">Y</emphasis> allele or a <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis> allele. Thus, there are four equally likely gametes that can be formed when the <emphasis effect="italics">YyRr</emphasis> heterozygote is self-crossed, as follows: <emphasis effect="italics">YR</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">Yr</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">yR</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="italics">yr</emphasis>. Arranging these gametes along the top and left of a 4 × 4 Punnett square (<link target-id="fig-ch12_03_02"/>) gives us 16 equally likely genotypic combinations. From these genotypes, we infer a phenotypic ratio of 9 round/yellow:3 round/green:3 wrinkled/yellow:1 wrinkled/green (<link target-id="fig-ch12_03_02"/>). These are the offspring ratios we would expect, assuming we performed the crosses with a large enough sample size.</para>
            <para id="fs-id1419827">Because of independent assortment and dominance, the 9:3:3:1 dihybrid phenotypic ratio can be collapsed into two 3:1 ratios, characteristic of any monohybrid cross that follows a dominant and recessive pattern. Ignoring seed color and considering only seed texture in the above dihybrid cross, we would expect that three quarters of the F<sub>2</sub> generation offspring would be round, and one quarter would be wrinkled. Similarly, isolating only seed color, we would assume that three quarters of the F<sub>2</sub> offspring would be yellow and one quarter would be green. The sorting of alleles for texture and color are independent events, so we can apply the product rule. Therefore, the proportion of round and yellow F<sub>2</sub> offspring is expected to be (3/4) × (3/4) = 9/16, and the proportion of wrinkled and green offspring is expected to be (1/4) × (1/4) = 1/16. These proportions are identical to those obtained using a Punnett square. Round, green and wrinkled, yellow offspring can also be calculated using the product rule, as each of these genotypes includes one dominant and one recessive phenotype. Therefore, the proportion of each is calculated as (3/4) × (1/4) = 3/16.</para>
            <para id="fs-id1423640">The law of independent assortment also indicates that a cross between yellow, wrinkled (<emphasis effect="italics">YYrr</emphasis>) and green, round (<emphasis effect="italics">yyRR</emphasis>) parents would yield the same F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> offspring as in the <emphasis effect="italics">YYRR</emphasis> x <emphasis effect="italics">yyrr</emphasis> cross.</para>
            <para id="fs-id1787767">The physical basis for the law of independent assortment also lies in meiosis I, in which the different homologous pairs line up in random orientations. Each gamete can contain any combination of paternal and maternal chromosomes (and therefore the genes on them) because the orientation of tetrads on the metaphase plane is random.</para>

                <para id="fs-id848714">When more than two genes are being considered, the Punnett-square method becomes unwieldy. For instance, examining a cross involving four genes would require a 16 × 16 grid containing 256 boxes. It would be extremely cumbersome to manually enter each genotype. For more complex crosses, the forked-line and probability methods are preferred.</para>
                <para id="fs-id1771716">To prepare a forked-line diagram for a cross between F<sub>1</sub> heterozygotes resulting from a cross between <emphasis effect="italics">AABBCC</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">aabbcc</emphasis> parents, we first create rows equal to the number of genes being considered, and then segregate the alleles in each row on forked lines according to the probabilities for individual monohybrid crosses (<link target-id="fig-ch12_03_03"/>). We then multiply the values along each forked path to obtain the F<sub>2</sub> offspring probabilities. Note that this process is a diagrammatic version of the product rule. The values along each forked pathway can be multiplied because each gene assorts independently. For a trihybrid cross, the F<sub>2</sub> phenotypic ratio is 27:9:9:9:3:3:3:1.</para>

                <title>Probability Method</title>
                <para id="fs-id1506540">While the forked-line method is a diagrammatic approach to keeping track of probabilities in a cross, the probability method gives the proportions of offspring expected to exhibit each phenotype (or genotype) without the added visual assistance. Both methods make use of the product rule and consider the alleles for each gene separately. Earlier, we examined the phenotypic proportions for a trihybrid cross using the forked-line method; now we will use the probability method to examine the genotypic proportions for a cross with even more genes.</para>
                <para id="fs-id1730879">For a trihybrid cross, writing out the forked-line method is tedious, albeit not as tedious as using the Punnett-square method. To fully demonstrate the power of the probability method, however, we can consider specific genetic calculations. For instance, for a tetrahybrid cross between individuals that are heterozygotes for all four genes, and in which all four genes are sorting independently and in a dominant and recessive pattern, what proportion of the offspring will be expected to be homozygous recessive for all four alleles? Rather than writing out every possible genotype, we can use the probability method. We know that for each gene, the fraction of homozygous recessive offspring will be 1/4. Therefore, multiplying this fraction for each of the four genes, (1/4) × (1/4) × (1/4) × (1/4), we determine that 1/256 of the offspring will be quadruply homozygous recessive.</para>
                <para id="fs-id1956700">For the same tetrahybrid cross, what is the expected proportion of offspring that have the dominant phenotype at all four loci? We can answer this question using phenotypic proportions, but let’s do it the hard way—using genotypic proportions. The question asks for the proportion of offspring that are 1) homozygous dominant at <emphasis effect="italics">A</emphasis> or heterozygous at <emphasis effect="italics">A,</emphasis> and 2) homozygous at <emphasis effect="italics">B</emphasis> or heterozygous at <emphasis effect="italics">B</emphasis>, and so on. Noting the “or” and “and” in each circumstance makes clear where to apply the sum and product rules.

Given a multihybrid cross that obeys independent assortment and follows a dominant and recessive pattern, several generalized rules exist; you can use these rules to check your results as you work through genetics calculations (<link target-id="tab-ch12-03-01"/>). To apply these rules, first you must determine <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis>, the number of heterozygous gene pairs (the number of genes segregating two alleles each). For example, a cross between <emphasis effect="italics">AaBb</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">AaBb</emphasis> heterozygotes has an <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> of 2. In contrast, a cross between <emphasis effect="italics">AABb</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">AABb</emphasis> has an <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> of 1 because <emphasis effect="italics">A</emphasis> is not heterozygous.</para>

Genes that are located on separate non-homologous chromosomes will always sort independently. However, each chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of genes, organized linearly on chromosomes like beads on a string. The segregation of alleles into gametes can be influenced by <term id="term-00005">linkage</term>, in which genes that are located physically close to each other on the same chromosome are more likely to be inherited as a pair. However, because of the process of recombination, or “crossover,” it is possible for two genes on the same chromosome to behave independently, or as if they are not linked. To understand this, let’s consider the biological basis of gene linkage and recombination.</para>
            <para id="fs-id1291437">Homologous chromosomes possess the same genes in the same linear order. The alleles may differ on homologous chromosome pairs, but the genes to which they correspond do not. In preparation for the first division of meiosis, homologous chromosomes replicate and synapse. Like genes on the homologs align with each other. At this stage, segments of homologous chromosomes exchange linear segments of genetic material (<link target-id="fig-ch12_03_04"/>). This process is called recombination, or crossover, and it is a common genetic process. Because the genes are aligned during recombination, the gene order is not altered. Instead, the result of recombination is that maternal and paternal alleles are combined onto the same chromosome. Across a given chromosome, several recombination events may occur, causing extensive shuffling of alleles.</para>
            <figure id="fig-ch12_03_04" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch12-s03-lo03 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch12-03-aplo-3-17"><media id="fs-id1974440" alt="This illustration shows a pair of homologous chromosomes. One of the pair has the alleles ABC and the other has the alleles abc. During meiosis, crossover occurs between two of the chromosomes and genetic material is exchanged, resulting in one recombinant chromosome that has the alleles ABc and another that has the alleles abC. The other two chromosomes are non-recombinant and have the same arrangement of genes as before meiosis.">

                <caption>The process of crossover, or recombination, occurs when two homologous chromosomes align during meiosis and exchange a segment of genetic material. Here, the alleles for gene C were exchanged. The result is two recombinant and two non-recombinant chromosomes (for clarity, only one recombination event between two of the four chromatids is represented).</caption></figure>
            <para id="fs-id1480432">When two genes are located in close proximity on the same chromosome, they are considered linked, and their alleles tend to be transmitted through meiosis together. To exemplify this, imagine a dihybrid cross involving flower color and plant height in which the genes are next to each other on the chromosome. If one homologous chromosome has alleles for tall plants and red flowers, and the other chromosome has genes for short plants and yellow flowers, then when the gametes are formed, the tall and red alleles will go together into a gamete and the short and yellow alleles will go into other gametes. These are called the parental genotypes because they have been inherited intact from the parents of the individual producing gametes. But unlike if the genes were on different chromosomes, there will be no gametes with tall and yellow alleles and no gametes with short and red alleles. If you create the Punnett square with these gametes, you will see that the classical Mendelian prediction of a 9:3:3:1 outcome of a dihybrid cross would not apply. As the distance between two genes increases, the probability of one or more crossovers between them increases, and the genes behave more like they are on separate chromosomes. Geneticists have used the proportion of recombinant gametes (the ones not like the parents) as a measure of how far apart genes are on a chromosome. Using this information, they have constructed elaborate maps of genes on chromosomes for well-studied organisms, including humans.</para><para id="fs-id2229220">Mendel’s seminal publication makes no mention of linkage, and many researchers have questioned whether he encountered linkage but chose not to publish those crosses out of concern that they would invalidate his independent assortment postulate. The garden pea has seven pairs of chromosomes, and some have suggested that his choice of seven characteristics was not a coincidence. However, even if the genes he examined were not located on separate chromosomes, it is possible that he simply did not observe linkage because of the extensive shuffling effects of recombination.</para><note id="fs-id2762809" class="experiment"><title>Testing the Hypothesis of Independent Assortment</title>

                <para id="fs-id1386450"><emphasis effect="bold">Background</emphasis>: Consider that pea plants mature in one growing season, and you have access to a large garden in which you can cultivate thousands of pea plants. There are several true-breeding plants with the following pairs of traits: tall plants with inflated pods, and dwarf plants with constricted pods. Before the plants have matured, you remove the pollen-producing organs from the tall/inflated plants in your crosses to prevent self-fertilization. Upon plant maturation, the plants are manually crossed by transferring pollen from the dwarf/constricted plants to the stigmata of the tall/inflated plants.</para>
                <para id="fs-id1778350"><emphasis effect="bold">Hypothesis</emphasis>: Both trait pairs will sort independently according to Mendelian laws. When the true-breeding parents are crossed, all of the F<sub>1</sub> offspring are tall and have inflated pods, which indicates that the tall and inflated traits are dominant over the dwarf and constricted traits, respectively. A self-cross of the F<sub>1</sub> heterozygotes results in 2,000 F<sub>2</sub> progeny.</para>
                <para id="fs-id2117483"><emphasis effect="bold">Test the hypothesis</emphasis>: Because each trait pair sorts independently, the ratios of tall:dwarf and inflated:constricted are each expected to be 3:1. The tall/dwarf trait pair is called <emphasis effect="italics">T/t</emphasis>, and the inflated/constricted trait pair is designated <emphasis effect="italics">I/i</emphasis>. Each member of the F<sub>1</sub> generation therefore has a genotype of <emphasis effect="italics">TtIi</emphasis>. Construct a grid analogous to <link target-id="fig-ch12_03_02"/>, in which you cross two <emphasis effect="italics">TtIi</emphasis> individuals. Each individual can donate four combinations of two traits: <emphasis effect="italics">TI</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">Ti</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">tI</emphasis>, or <emphasis effect="italics">ti</emphasis>, meaning that there are 16 possibilities of offspring genotypes. Because the <emphasis effect="italics">T</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">I</emphasis> alleles are dominant, any individual having one or two of those alleles will express the tall or inflated phenotypes, respectively, regardless if they also have a <emphasis effect="italics">t</emphasis> or <emphasis effect="italics">i</emphasis> allele. Only individuals that are <emphasis effect="italics">tt</emphasis> or <emphasis effect="italics">ii</emphasis> will express the dwarf and constricted alleles, respectively. As shown in <link target-id="fig-ch12_03_06"/>, you predict that you will observe the following offspring proportions: tall/inflated:tall/constricted:dwarf/inflated:dwarf/constricted in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Notice from the grid that when considering the tall/dwarf and inflated/constricted trait pairs in isolation, they are each inherited in 3:1 ratios.</para>

<para id="fs-id1262149">In some cases, several genes can contribute to aspects of a common phenotype without their gene products ever directly interacting. In the case of organ development, for instance, genes may be expressed sequentially, with each gene adding to the complexity and specificity of the organ. Genes may function in complementary or synergistic fashions, such that two or more genes need to be expressed simultaneously to affect a phenotype. Genes may also oppose each other, with one gene modifying the expression of another.</para>
            <para id="fs-id1445150">In <term id="term-00007">epistasis</term>, the interaction between genes is antagonistic, such that one gene masks or interferes with the expression of another. “Epistasis” is a word composed of Greek roots that mean “standing upon.” The alleles that are being masked or silenced are said to be hypostatic to the epistatic alleles that are doing the masking. Often the biochemical basis of epistasis is a gene pathway in which the expression of one gene is dependent on the function of a gene that precedes or follows it in the pathway.</para>
            <para id="fs-id883702">An example of epistasis is pigmentation in mice. The wild-type coat color, agouti (<emphasis effect="italics">AA</emphasis>), is dominant to solid-colored fur (<emphasis effect="italics">aa</emphasis>). However, a separate gene (<emphasis effect="italics">C</emphasis>) is necessary for pigment production.

Therefore, the genotypes <emphasis effect="italics">AAcc</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">Aacc</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="italics">aacc</emphasis> all produce the same albino phenotype.

Similarly, we would expect interacting gene pairs to also exhibit ratios expressed as 16 parts.

            <title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-id1438790">Mendel postulated that genes (characteristics) are inherited as pairs of alleles (traits) that behave in a dominant and recessive pattern. Alleles segregate into gametes such that each gamete is equally likely to receive either one of the two alleles present in a diploid individual. In addition, genes are assorted into gametes independently of one another. That is, alleles are generally not more likely to segregate into a gamete with a particular allele of another gene. A dihybrid cross demonstrates independent assortment when the genes in question are on different chromosomes or distant from each other on the same chromosome. For crosses involving more than two genes, use the forked line or probability methods to predict offspring genotypes and phenotypes rather than a Punnett square.</para>
            <para id="fs-id2896310">Although chromosomes sort independently into gametes during meiosis, Mendel’s law of independent assortment refers to genes, not chromosomes, and a single chromosome may carry more than 1,000 genes. When genes are located in close proximity on the same chromosome, their alleles tend to be inherited together. This results in offspring ratios that violate Mendel's law of independent assortment. However, recombination serves to exchange genetic material on homologous chromosomes such that maternal and paternal alleles may be recombined on the same chromosome. This is why alleles on a given chromosome are not always inherited together. Recombination is a random event occurring anywhere on a chromosome. Therefore, genes that are far apart on the same chromosome are likely to still assort independently because of recombination events that occurred in the intervening chromosomal space.</para>
            <para id="fs-id1360917">Whether or not they are sorting independently, genes may interact at the level of gene products such that the expression of an allele for one gene masks or modifies the expression of an allele for a different gene. This is called epistasis.</para>

<problem id="fs-id1164968641119">
<para id="fs-id1164963066838">Gregor Mendels 1865 paper described experiments on the inheritance of seven characteristics of <emphasis effect="italics">Pisum sativum</emphasis> shown in the first column in the table below. Many years later, based on his reported outcomes and analysis of the inheritance of a single characteristic, Mendel developed the concepts of genes, their alleles, and dominance. These concepts are defined in the second column of the table using conventional symbols for the dominant allele for each characteristic. Even later, the location of each of these genes on one of the seven chromosomes in <emphasis effect="italics">P. sativum</emphasis> were determined, as shown in the third column.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164968592692">A. Before the acceptance of what Mendel called factors as the discrete units of inheritance, the accepted model was that the traits of progeny were blended traits of the parents. <emphasis>Evaluate the evidence</emphasis> provided by Mendels experiments in disproving the blending theory of inheritance.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164968677224">B. Mendel published experimental data and analysis for two experiments involving the inheritance of more than a single characteristic.  He examined two-character inheritance of seed shape and seed color. He also reported three-character inheritance of seed shape, seed color, and flower color.  <emphasis>Evaluate the evidence</emphasis> provided by the multiple-character experiments. <emphasis>Identify</emphasis> which of the following laws of inheritance depend upon these multiple-character experiments for support:</para>
<list id="fs-id1164969022398" list-type="enumerated" number-style="lower-alpha"><item>During gamete formation, the alleles for each gene segregate from each other so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene.</item>
<item>Genes for different traits can segregate independently during the formation of gametes.</item>
<item>Some alleles are dominant, whereas others are recessive.  An organism with at least one dominant allele will display the effect of the dominant allele.</item>
<item>All three laws can be inferred from the single-character experiments.</item>
</list><para id="fs-id1164968957955">C. As shown in the table above, some chromosomes contain the gene for more than one of the seven characteristics Mendel studied, for example, seed color and flowers.  The table below shows, with filled cells above the dashed diagonal line, the combinations of characteristics for which Mendel reported results.  In the cells below the dotted diagonal line, <emphasis>identify with an X</emphasis> each cell where deviations from the law or laws identified in part B might be expected.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164968574104">A dihybrid cross involves two traits.  A cross of parental types AaBb and AaBb can be represented with a Punnett square:</para>

</figure><para id="fs-id1164958668486">This representation clearly organizes all of the possible genotypes and reveals the 9:3:3:1 distribution of phenotypes and a 4×4 grid of 16 cells.  Expressed as a fraction of the 16 possible genotypes of the offspring, the phenotypic ratio describes the probability of each phenotype among the offspring: 3 (AA, Aa, aA) × 3 (BB, bB, Bb)/16 = 9/16; 3 (AA, Aa, aA) × 1 (bb) /16 = 3/16; 1 (aa) × 3 (BB, bB, Bb) = 3/16; and 1 (aa) × 1 (bb) = 1/16.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164968676050">A. Using the probability method, calculate the likelihood of these phenotypes from each dihybrid cross:</para>

<item>recessive in both genes from the cross AaBb × aabb</item>
<item>recessive in either gene from the cross AaBb × aabb</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-id1164966267157">A Punnett square representation of a trihybrid cross, such as the self-cross of AaBbCc, is more cumbersome because there are eight columns and rows (2×2×2 ways to choose parental genotypes) and 64 cells.  A less tedious representation is to calculate the number of each type of genotype in the offspring directly by counting the unique permutations of the letters representing the alleles.  For example, the probability of the cross AaBbCc × AaBbCc is 3 (AA, Aa, aA) × 3 (BB, Bb, bB) × 3 (CC, Cc, cC)/64 = 27/64.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164968968437">B. Using the probability method, <emphasis>calculate</emphasis> the likelihood of these phenotypes from each trihybrid cross:</para>

<para id="fs-id1164966602929">C. The probability method is an easy way to calculate the likelihood of each particular phenotype, but it doesnt simultaneously display the probability of all possible phenotypes.
