<para id="fs-idp55079744"><term id="term-00001">Bryophytes</term> are the closest extant relatives of early terrestrial plants. The first bryophytes (liverworts) most likely appeared in the Ordovician period, about 450 million years ago. Because they lack lignin and other resistant structures, the likelihood of bryophytes forming fossils is rather small. Some spores protected by <emphasis effect="italics">sporopollenin</emphasis> have survived and are attributed to early bryophytes. By the Silurian period (435 MYA), however, vascular plants had spread through the continents. This compelling fact is used as evidence that non-vascular plants must have preceded the Silurian period.</para>
<para id="fs-idp69469856">More than 25,000 species of bryophytes thrive in mostly damp habitats, although some live in deserts. They constitute the major flora of inhospitable environments like the tundra, where their small size and tolerance to desiccation offer distinct advantages. They generally lack lignin and do not have actual tracheids (xylem cells specialized for water conduction). Rather, water and nutrients circulate inside specialized conducting cells. Although the term <emphasis effect="italics">non-tracheophyte</emphasis> is more accurate, bryophytes are commonly called <emphasis effect="italics">non-vascular plants</emphasis>.</para>
<para id="fs-idp129949424">In a bryophyte, all the conspicuous vegetative organs—including the photosynthetic leaf-like structures, the thallus (“plant body”), stem, and the rhizoid that anchors the plant to its substrate—belong to the haploid organism or gametophyte. The male gametes formed by bryophytes swim with a flagellum, so fertilization is dependent on the presence of water. The bryophyte embryo also remains attached to the parent plant, which protects and nourishes it. The <term id="term-00002">sporophyte</term> that develops from the embryo is barely noticeable. The <term id="term-00003">sporangium</term>—the multicellular sexual reproductive structure in which meiosis produces haploid spores—is present in bryophytes and absent in the majority of algae. This is also a characteristic of land plants.</para>
<para id="fs-idp185953312">The bryophytes are divided into three phyla: the liverworts or Marchantiophyta, the hornworts or Anthocerotophyta, and the mosses or true Bryophyta.</para><section id="fs-idp74140832">
<title>Liverworts</title>
<para id="fs-idp255585568"><term id="term-00004">Liverworts</term> (Marchantiophyta) are currently classified as the plants most closely related to the ancestor of vascular plants that adapted to terrestrial environments. In fact, liverworts have colonized every terrestrial habitat on Earth and diversified to more than 7000 existing species (<link target-id="fig-ch25_03_01"/>). Lobate liverworts form a flat thallus, with lobes that have a vague resemblance to the lobes of the liver (<link target-id="fig-ch25_03_02"/>), which accounts for the name given to the phylum. Leafy liverworts have tiny leaflike structures attached to a stalk. Several leafy liverworts are shown in <link target-id="fig-ch25_03_01"/>.</para><figure id="fig-ch25_03_01"><media id="fs-idp103270144" alt="The illustration shows a variety of liverworts, which all share a branched, leafy structure.">

<caption>Liverwort gametophyte. A liverwort, <emphasis effect="italics">Lunularia cruciata</emphasis>, displays its lobate, flat thallus. The organism in the photograph is in the gametophyte stage, but has not yet produced gametangia. <emphasis effect="italics">Lunularia</emphasis> gametophytes produce crescent-shaped <term id="term-00005">gemmae</term> (circled), which contain asexual spores. The tiny white dots on the surface of the thallus are air pores.</caption></figure><para id="fs-idp18139680">Openings in the thallus that allow the movement of gases may be observed in liverworts (<link target-id="fig-ch25_03_02"/>). However, these are <emphasis effect="italics">not</emphasis> stomata, because they do not actively open and close by the action of guard cells. Instead, the thallus takes up water over its entire surface and has no cuticle to prevent desiccation, which explains their preferred wet habitats. <link target-id="fig-ch25_03_03"/> represents the lifecycle of a lobate liverwort. Haploid spores germinate into flattened thalli attached to the substrate by thin, single-celled filaments. Stalk-like structures (<emphasis effect="italics">gametophores</emphasis>) grow from the thallus and carry male and female gametangia, which may develop on separate, individual plants, or on the same plant, depending on the species. Flagellated male gametes develop within <emphasis effect="italics">antheridia</emphasis> (male gametangia). The female gametes develop within <emphasis effect="italics">archegonia</emphasis> (female gametangia). Once released, the male gametes swim with the aid of their flagella to an archegonium, and fertilization ensues. The zygote grows into a small sporophyte still contained in the archegonium. The diploid zygote will give rise, by meiosis, to the next generation of haploid spores, which can be disseminated by wind or water. In many liverworts, spore dispersal is facilitated by <emphasis effect="italics">elaters</emphasis>—long single cells that suddenly change shape as they dry out and throw adjacent spores out of the spore capsule. Liverwort plants can also reproduce asexually, by the breaking of “branches” or the spreading of leaf fragments called gemmae. In this latter type of reproduction, the <term id="term-00006">gemmae</term>—small, intact, complete pieces of plant that are produced in a cup on the surface of the thallus (shown in <link target-id="fig-ch25_03_03"/> and <link target-id="fig-ch25_03_04"/>)—are splashed out of the cup by raindrops. The gemmae then land nearby and develop into gametophytes.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch25_03_03"><media id="fs-idm19197664" alt="The liverwort has a flat, leaf-like structure called a thallus, which is haploid (1n). Root-like rhizoids grow from the bottom of the thallus. Gemma cups used for asexual reproduction grow on top of the thallus. A slender stalk extends from the thallus, and a haploid (1n) archegonial head sits at its top. The archegonial head is the female gametophyte. The archegonial head has fronds, like a palm tree. The underside of the archegonial head contains protrusions called archegonia, which house the eggs. Another stalk extends from another thallus, and a haploid (1n) antheridial head sits at its top. The antheridial head is the male gametophyte. The outside of the antheridial head has antheridia which release sperm. The haploid (1n) sperm swim through a hole in the bottom of the archegonium and fertilize the haploid (1n) egg to produce a diploid (2n) embryo. The embryo grows into a stalk called a seta. Meiosis produces haploid (1n) spores in a sac at the tip of the stalk. The sac bursts open, releasing the spores. The spores sprout, producing a new thallus and rhizoids.">

<title>Hornworts</title>
<para id="fs-idp18682528">The defining characteristic of the hornworts (<emphasis effect="italics">Anthocerotophyta</emphasis>) is the narrow, pipe-like sporophyte. Hornworts have colonized a variety of habitats on land, although they are never far from a source of moisture. The short, blue-green gametophyte is the dominant phase of the life cycle of a hornwort. The sporophytes emerge from the parent gametophyte and continue to grow throughout the life of the plant (<link target-id="fig-ch25_03_04"/>).</para>
<figure id="fig-ch25_03_04"><media id="fs-idp77183440" alt="The base of the hornwort plant, called the thallus, has a wrinkled, leaf-like appearance. The sporophytes, a cluster of slender green stalks with brown tips, grow from this wrinkled mass.">

<caption>Hornwort sporophytes. Hornworts grow a tall and slender sporophyte. (credit: modification of work by Jason Hollinger)</caption></figure><para id="fs-idp40993168">Stomata (air pores that can be opened and closed) appear in the hornworts and are abundant on the sporophyte. Photosynthetic cells in the thallus each contain a single chloroplast. Meristem cells at the base of the plant keep dividing and adding to the height of the sporophyte. This growth pattern is unique to the hornworts. Many hornworts establish symbiotic relationships with cyanobacteria that fix nitrogen from the environment.</para>
<para id="fs-idp38143760">The lifecycle of hornworts (<link target-id="fig-ch25_03_05"/>) follows the general pattern of <emphasis effect="italics">alternation of generations</emphasis>. The gametophytes grow as flat thalli on the soil with embedded male and female gametangia. Flagellated sperm swim to the archegonia and fertilize eggs. The zygote develops into a long and slender sporophyte that eventually splits open down the side, releasing spores. Thin branched cells called pseudoelaters surround the spores and help propel them farther in the environment. The haploid spores germinate and give rise to the next generation of gametophytes.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch25_03_05"><media id="fs-idp32529008" alt="In hornworts, the gametophyte is a haploid 1 n leaf-like structure with slender stalks called rhizoids underneath. Male sex organs called antheridia produce sperm, and female sex organs called archegonia produce eggs. Both male and female sex organs form just beneath the surface of the gametophyte, and are exposed to the surface as the organs mature. The sperm swims to the egg or is propelled by water. When the egg is fertilized, the embryo grows into a hollow tube-like structure called a sporophyte. Meiosis inside the sporophyte produces haploid 1 n spores. The spores are ejected from the top of the tube. They grow into new gametophytes, completing the cycle.">

<section id="fs-idp118696896">
<title>Mosses</title>
<para id="fs-idp205099984">The mosses are the most numerous of the non-vascular plants. More than 10,000 species of <term id="term-00007">mosses</term> have been catalogued. Their habitats vary from the tundra, where they are the main vegetation, to the understory of tropical forests. In the tundra, the mosses’ shallow rhizoids allow them to fasten to a substrate without penetrating the frozen soil. Mosses slow down erosion, store moisture and soil nutrients, and provide shelter for small animals as well as food for larger herbivores, such as the musk ox. Mosses are very sensitive to air pollution and are used to monitor air quality. They are also sensitive to copper salts, so these salts are a common ingredient of compounds marketed to eliminate mosses from lawns.</para>
<para id="fs-idp118341040">Mosses form diminutive gametophytes, which are the dominant phase of the lifecycle. Green, flat structures with a simple midrib—resembling true leaves, but lacking stomata and vascular tissue—are attached in a spiral to a central stalk. Mosses have stomata only on the sporophyte. Water and nutrients are absorbed directly through the leaflike structures of the gametophyte. Some mosses have small branches. A primitive conductive system that carries water and nutrients runs up the gametophyte's stalk, but does not extend into the leaves. Additionally, mosses are anchored to the substrate—whether it is soil, rock, or roof tiles—by multicellular <term id="term-00008">rhizoids</term>, precursors of roots. They originate from the base of the gametophyte, but are not the major route for the absorption of water and minerals. The lack of a true root system explains why it is so easy to rip moss mats from a tree trunk. The mosses therefore occupy a threshold position between other bryophytes and the vascular plants.</para>
<para id="fs-idp1187341040">The moss lifecycle follows the pattern of alternation of generations as shown in <link target-id="fig-ch25_03_06"/>. The most familiar structure is the haploid gametophyte, which germinates from a haploid spore and forms first a <term id="term-00009">protonema</term>—usually, a tangle of single-celled filaments that hug the ground. Cells akin to an apical meristem actively divide and give rise to a gametophore, consisting of a photosynthetic stem and foliage-like structures. Male and female gametangia develop at the tip of separate gametophores. The antheridia (male organs) produce many sperm, whereas the archegonia (the female organs) each form a single egg at the base (venter) of a flask-shaped structure. The archegonium produces attractant substances and at fertilization, the sperm swims down the neck to the venter and unites with the egg inside the archegonium. The zygote, protected by the archegonium, divides and grows into a sporophyte, still attached by its foot to the gametophyte.</para>

Root-like rhizoids grow from the bottom. Male antheridia and female archegonia grow at the tip of the stem. Sperm fertilize the eggs, producing a diploid (2n) zygote inside a vase-like structure called a venter inside the archegonial head. The embryo grows into a sporophyte that projects like a flower from the vase. The sporophyte undergoes meiosis to produce haploid (1n) spores that grow to produce mature gametophytes, completing the cycle.">

A structure called the operculum is at the tip of the spore capsule. The calyptra and operculum fall off when the spores are ready for dispersal. The peristome, tissue around the mouth of the capsule, is made of triangular, close-fitting units like little “teeth.” The peristome opens and closes, depending on moisture levels, and periodically releases spores.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-idp71190016">Seedless non-vascular plants are small, having the gametophyte as the dominant stage of the lifecycle. Without a vascular system and roots, they absorb water and nutrients on all their exposed surfaces. Collectively known as bryophytes, the three main groups include the liverworts, the hornworts, and the mosses. Liverworts are the most primitive plants and are closely related to the first land plants. Hornworts developed stomata and possess a single chloroplast per cell. Mosses have simple conductive cells and are attached to the substrate by rhizoids. They colonize harsh habitats and can regain moisture after drying out.
