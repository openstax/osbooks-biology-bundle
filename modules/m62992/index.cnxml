<para id="fs-id1167064535559" class="ost-reading-discard">The heart is a perfect example of the relationship between structure and function. The four-chambered heart of mammals with its unique cardiac muscle, one-way valves, and vessels is designed to transport vital oxygen (O<sup>2</sup>) to the body cells and remove carbon dioxide (CO<sup>2</sup>) from tissues. The intricate design of the heart separates blood that is low in O<sup>2</sup> from blood that is high in O<sup>2</sup>. This ensures that oxygen-rich blood is delivered to all tissues and cells of the body where it will be used for cellular respiration. Blood returning from the tissues is high in CO<sup>2</sup> and low in O<sup>2</sup> will return to the heart and be pumped to the lungs, where gases are exchanged by diffusion at capillary beds.</para>

<para id="fs-idm49489856">The heart is a complex muscle that pumps blood through the three divisions of the circulatory system: the coronary (vessels that serve the heart), pulmonary (heart and lungs), and systemic (systems of the body), as shown in <link target-id="fig-ch40_03_01"/>. Coronary circulation intrinsic to the heart takes blood directly from the main artery (aorta) coming from the heart. For pulmonary and systemic circulation, the heart has to pump blood to the lungs or the rest of the body, respectively. In vertebrates, the lungs are relatively close to the heart in the thoracic cavity. The shorter distance to pump means that the muscle wall on the right side of the heart is not as thick as the left side which must have enough pressure to pump blood all the way to your big toe.</para>

<title>Structure of the Heart</title>
<para id="fs-idp58983376">The heart muscle is asymmetrical as a result of the distance blood must travel in the pulmonary and systemic circuits. Since the right side of the heart sends blood to the pulmonary circuit it is smaller than the left side which must send blood out to the whole body in the systemic circuit, as shown in <link target-id="fig-ch40_03_02"/>. In humans, the heart is about the size of a clenched fist; it is divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. There is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one atrium and one ventricle on the left side. The atria are the chambers that receive blood, and the ventricles are the chambers that pump blood. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the <emphasis>superior vena cava</emphasis>, which drains blood from the jugular vein that comes from the brain and from the veins that come from the arms, as well as from the <emphasis>inferior vena cava</emphasis> which drains blood from the veins that come from the lower organs and the legs. In addition, the right atrium receives blood from the coronary sinus which drains deoxygenated blood from the heart itself. This deoxygenated blood then passes to the right ventricle through the <emphasis>atrioventricular valve</emphasis> or the <emphasis>tricuspid valve</emphasis>, a flap of connective tissue that opens in only one direction to prevent the backflow of blood. The valve separating the chambers on the left side of the heart valve is called the biscuspid or mitral valve. After it is filled, the right ventricle pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries, by-passing the <emphasis>semilunar valve</emphasis> (or pulmonic valve) to the lungs for re-oxygenation. After blood passes through the pulmonary arteries, the right semilunar valves close preventing the blood from flowing backwards into the right ventricle. The left atrium then receives the oxygen-rich blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins. This blood passes through the <emphasis>bicuspid valve</emphasis> or mitral valve (the atrioventricular valve on the left side of the heart) to the left ventricle where the blood is pumped out through <emphasis>aorta</emphasis>, the major artery of the body, taking oxygenated blood to the organs and muscles of the body. Once blood is pumped out of the left ventricle and into the aorta, the aortic semilunar valve (or aortic valve) closes preventing blood from flowing backward into the left ventricle. This pattern of pumping is referred to as double circulation and is found in all mammals.</para>

The <emphasis>myocardium</emphasis> consists of the heart muscle cells that make up the middle layer and the bulk of the heart wall. The outer layer of cells is called the <emphasis>epicardium</emphasis>, of which the second layer is a membranous layered structure called the <emphasis>pericardium</emphasis> that surrounds and protects the heart; it allows enough room for vigorous pumping but also keeps the heart in place to reduce friction between the heart and other structures.</para>

<title>The Cardiac Cycle</title>
<para id="fs-idm116254208">The main purpose of the heart is to pump blood through the body; it does so in a repeating sequence called the cardiac cycle. The <emphasis>cardiac cycle</emphasis> is the coordination of the filling and emptying of the heart of blood by electrical signals that cause the heart muscles to contract and relax. The human heart beats over 100,000 times per day. In each cardiac cycle, the heart contracts (<emphasis>systole</emphasis>), pushing out the blood and pumping it through the body; this is followed by a relaxation phase (<emphasis>diastole</emphasis>), where the heart fills with blood, as illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch40_03_03"/>. The atria contract at the same time, forcing blood through the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles. Closing of the atrioventricular valves produces a monosyllabic “lup” sound. Following a brief delay, the ventricles contract at the same time forcing blood through the semilunar valves into the aorta and the artery transporting blood to the lungs (via the pulmonary artery). Closing of the semilunar valves produces a monosyllabic “dup” sound.</para>

The electrical signals and mechanical actions, illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch40_03_05"/>, are intimately intertwined. The internal pacemaker starts at the <emphasis>sinoatrial (SA) node</emphasis>, which is located near the wall of the right atrium. Electrical charges spontaneously pulse from the SA node causing the two atria to contract in unison. The pulse reaches a second node, called the atrioventricular (AV) node, between the right atrium and right ventricle where it pauses for approximately 0.1 second before spreading to the walls of the ventricles. From the AV node, the electrical impulse enters the bundle of His, then to the left and right bundle branches extending through the interventricular septum. Finally, the Purkinje fibers conduct the impulse from the apex of the heart up the ventricular myocardium, and then the ventricles contract. This pause allows the atria to empty completely into the ventricles before the ventricles pump out the blood. The electrical impulses in the heart produce electrical currents that flow through the body and can be measured on the skin using electrodes. This information can be observed as an <emphasis>electrocardiogram (ECG)</emphasis>—a recording of the electrical impulses of the cardiac muscle.</para>

The signal then coalesces at the atrioventricular node, causing the ECG reading to flat-line briefly. Next, the signal passes from the atrioventricular node to the Purkinje fibers, which travel from the atriovenricular node and down the middle of the heart, between the two ventricles, to the apex (the bottom of the heart), then up the sides of the ventricles. As the signal passes down the Purkinje fibers the ECG reading falls. The signal then spreads throughout the ventricle walls, and the ventricles contract, resulting in a sharp spike in the ECG. The spike is followed by a flat-line, longer than the first, then a bump.">

Capillaries are narrow-diameter tubes that can fit red blood cells through in single file and are the sites for the exchange of nutrients, waste, and oxygen with tissues at the cellular level. Fluid also crosses into the interstitial space from the capillaries. The capillaries converge again into <emphasis>venules</emphasis> that connect to minor veins that finally connect to major veins that take blood high in carbon dioxide back to the heart. <emphasis>Veins</emphasis> are blood vessels that bring blood back to the heart. The major veins drain blood from the same organs and limbs that the major arteries supply. Fluid is also brought back to the heart via the lymphatic system.</para>
<para id="fs-idm69642496">The structure of the different types of blood vessels reflects their function or layers. There are three distinct layers, or tunics, that form the walls of blood vessels (<link target-id="fig-ch40_03_07"/>). The first tunic is a smooth, inner lining of endothelial cells that are in contact with the red blood cells. The endothelial tunic is continuous with the endocardium of the heart. In capillaries, this single layer of cells is the location of diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the endothelial cells and red blood cells, as well as the exchange site via endocytosis and exocytosis. The movement of materials at the site of capillaries is regulated by <emphasis>vasoconstriction</emphasis>, narrowing of the blood vessels, and <emphasis>vasodilation</emphasis>, widening of the blood vessels; this is important in the overall regulation of blood pressure.</para>
<para id="fs-idm46223136">Veins and arteries both have two further tunics that surround the endothelium: the middle tunic is composed of smooth muscle and the outermost layer is connective tissue (collagen and elastic fibers). The elastic connective tissue stretches and supports the blood vessels, and the smooth muscle layer helps regulate blood flow by altering vascular resistance through vasoconstriction and vasodilation. The arteries have thicker smooth muscle and connective tissue than the veins to accommodate the higher pressure and speed of freshly pumped blood. The veins are thinner walled as the pressure and rate of flow are much lower. In addition, veins are structurally different than arteries in that veins have valves to prevent the backflow of blood. Because veins have to work against gravity to get blood back to the heart, contraction of skeletal muscle assists with the flow of blood back to the heart.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-idm146392688">The heart muscle pumps blood through three divisions of the circulatory system: coronary, pulmonary, and systemic. There is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one atrium and one ventricle on the left side. The pumping of the heart is a function of cardiomyocytes, distinctive muscle cells that are striated like skeletal muscle but pump rhythmically and involuntarily like smooth muscle. The internal pacemaker starts at the sinoatrial node, which is located near the wall of the right atrium. Electrical charges pulse from the SA node causing the two atria to contract in unison; then the pulse reaches the atrioventricular node between the right atrium and right ventricle. A pause in the electric signal allows the atria to empty completely into the ventricles before the ventricles pump out the blood. The blood from the heart is carried through the body by a complex network of blood vessels; arteries take blood away from the heart, and veins bring blood back to the heart.</para>
