<title>Connection for AP<sup>®</sup> Courses</title><para id="fs-id1167067176090">Since the rediscovery of Mendel’s work in the 1900s, scientists have learned much about how the genetic blueprints stored in DNA are capable of replication, expression, and mutation. Just as the 26 letters of the English alphabet can be arranged into what seems to be a limitless number of words, with new ones added to the dictionary every year, the four nucleotides of DNA—A, T, C, and G—can generate sequences of DNA called genes that specify tens of thousands of polymers of amino acids. In turn, these sequences can be transcribed into mRNA and translated into proteins which orchestrate nearly every function of the cell. The genetic code refers to the DNA alphabet (A, T, C, G), the RNA alphabet (A, U, C, G), and the polypeptide alphabet (20 amino acids). But how do genes located on a chromosome ultimately produce a polypeptide that can result in a physical phenotype such as hair or eye color—or a disease like cystic fibrosis or hemophilia?</para><para id="fs-id1167066971938">The Central Dogma describes the normal flow of genetic information from DNA to mRNA to protein: DNA in genes specify sequences of mRNA which, in turn, specify amino acid sequences in proteins. The process requires two steps, transcription and translation. During transcription, genes are used to make messenger RNA (mRNA). In turn, the mRNA is used to direct the synthesis of proteins during the process of translation. Translation also requires two other types of RNA: transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The genetic code is a triplet code, with each RNA codon consisting of three consecutive nucleotides that specify one amino acid or the release of the newly formed polypeptide chain; for example, the mRNA codon CAU specifies the amino acid histidine. The code is degenerate; that is, some amino acids are specified by more than one codon, like synonyms you study in your English class (different word, same meaning). For example, CCU, CCC, CCA, and CCG are all codons for proline. It is important to remember the same genetic code is universal to almost all organisms on Earth. Small variations in codon assignment exist in mitochondria and some microorganisms.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167063514661">Deviations from the simple scheme of the central dogma are discovered as researchers explore gene expression with new technology. For example the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus which stores its genetic information in single stranded RNA molecules. Upon infection of a host cell, RNA is used as a template by the virally encoded enzyme, reverse transcriptase, to synthesize DNA. The viral DNA is later transcribed into mRNA and translated into proteins. Some RNA viruses such as the influenza virus never go through a DNA step. The RNA genome is replicated by an RNA dependent RNA polymerase which is virally encoded.</para>

<label>Background Information</label>
<para id="fs-id1167067142911">The Central Dogma has been validated by many experiments. The flow of information from DNA to mRNA to polypeptide is the common scheme in all cells, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic. The information in DNA is contained in the sequence of nitrogenous bases. Next question is, How is the sequence of the nitrogenous bases translated into amino acids? A combination of two out of the four letters gives 16 possible amino acids (4<sup>2</sup> = 16); for example, AA, or AC; but, there 20 amino acids. A combination of three bases gives 64 possible sets (4<sup>3</sup> = 64); for example, AAA or AAC. A combination of three bases in a row is a codon or “triplets.” This gives rise to more than enough combinations for the 20 common acids. Some amino acids are specified by a single codon, for example, methionine and tryptophan; others are encoded by up to six independent codons, for example, leucine.</para><para id="fs-id1167066881417">Although protein synthesis follows the same general scheme in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the detailed mechanism of each can be quite different. The presence of the nuclear membrane adds a layer of complexity to the process. In prokaryotes, transcription and translation are tightly coupled. As soon as the 5'-end of a mRNA has been transcribed from the template strand of DNA, ribosomes can latch onto it and polypeptide synthesis begins. Eukaryotic cells use a more complex series of steps. The enzyme RNA polymerase forms the transcription initiation complex with many proteins called transcription factors. The product of transcription, mRNA undergoes several modifications that change its stability and facilitate export from the nucleus. These extra steps allow greater control over gene expression. Although prokaryotic mRNA is not generally modified, eukaryotic mRNA strands undergo the addition of a methyl-guanosine cap at the 5'-end and a poly-adenosine tail at the 3'- end, without which they may not exit the nucleus. The mRNA also undergoes splicing to remove introns, the non–protein–coding regions of the gene. Protein translation depends on the presence of ribosomes, mRNA, a full complement of tRNA molecules, many enzymes, and many protein factors. As the polypeptide is synthesized, it starts folding into its three-dimensional structure. Further modifications will ensure that the protein is fully functional and shipped to its destination.</para><para id="fs-id1167066945024">Ask the students what a dogma is. It will serve as an introduction to deviations from the Central Dogma. Viruses show numerous variations. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a retrovirus. Its genome is encoded in RNA molecules which serve as a template for the synthesis of DNA by a virally encoded enzyme called reverse transcriptase. Point out that this enzyme, which is not found in humans, is the target of many anti-HIV medications. The flu virus carries non-coding strands of RNA molecules which are replicated in the host cell by a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, an enzyme encoded in the viral genome. In the case of the flu virus, there is no DNA stage at all. The flow of information is RNA to RNA to proteins. Closer to “home,” the telomeres, the ends of the linear chromosomes in eukaryotes, are replicated by a special enzyme, a telomerase, which synthesizes DNA from an RNA template.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167066804180">Just as we transfer information using letters and numbers, the cell transfers information using molecules. Emphasize the similarities between writing and the genetic code. Tell the students that much of the vocabulary of molecular genetics is borrowed from editing: transcription, translation, proofreading, missense, nonsense, etc.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167066805242">Although the chapter does not use the term “open reading frame,” tie it to <link target-id="fig-ch15_01_05"/>. An open reading frame is a DNA sequence that follows a start codon and ends with a stop codon. A long open reading frame is likely to be a gene.</para>

<label>Misconception Alert</label>
<para id="fs-id1167066828008">Students confuse the vocabulary used to describe the Central Dogma. Copying information from DNA to RNA is transcription because the language is the same. Both are constructed using nucleotides. When a polypeptide is synthesized, the building blocks or “letters” have switched to amino acids. It is a translation. Although not quite identical, show students an example similar to the following:</para>
<para id="fs-id1167066960190">Dog to <emphasis effect="italics">Dog </emphasis>(transcription) to Canis (translation)</para>
<para id="fs-id1167067025032">The first two words represent transcription. The letters are just copied. The last word has the same meaning, “dog” in Latin, but now the language is different.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167063486484">Consider using the word “redundant” to help explain the meaning of the word “degenerate” in this context. Students confuse the fact that the code is degenerate—several codons can encode the same amino acid—with the fact that the genetic code is universal, which means that the same codon, AUG as an example, is translated as methionine in all cells. The confusion arises from students learning the two concepts at the same time. Give examples of changes in the codons which result in the same amino acids. Although the gene sequence is different, the polypeptide is the same. Remind students that each codon specifies one amino acid, but the reverse is not true. Depending on the amino acid, more than one codon will translate to the same amino acid.</para><para id="fs-id1167067065726">Explain that many proteins of interest are synthesized in bacteria and yeast by inserting the genes for the proteins in the host expression systems. This is possible because the code is universal. If a gene coding for human insulin is inserted in the chromosomes of <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis>, the bacteria will synthesize human insulin.</para>

Translation of the mRNA template converts nucleotide-based genetic information into a protein product. Protein sequences consist of 20 commonly occurring amino acids; therefore, it can be said that the protein alphabet consists of 20 letters (<link target-id="fig-ch15_01_01"/>). Each amino acid is defined by a three-nucleotide sequence called the triplet codon. Different amino acids have different chemistries (such as acidic versus basic, or polar and nonpolar) and different structural constraints. Variation in amino acid sequence gives rise to enormous variation in protein structure and function.</para>

<title>The Central Dogma: DNA Encodes RNA; RNA Encodes Protein</title>
<para id="fs-id2155314">The flow of genetic information in cells from DNA to mRNA to protein is described by the <term id="term-00001">Central Dogma</term> (<link target-id="fig-ch15_01_02"/>), which states that genes specify the sequence of mRNAs, which in turn specify the sequence of proteins. The decoding of one molecule to another is performed by specific proteins and RNAs. Because the information stored in DNA is so central to cellular function, it makes intuitive sense that the cell would make mRNA copies of this information for protein synthesis, while keeping the DNA itself intact and protected. The copying of DNA to RNA is relatively straightforward, with one nucleotide being added to the mRNA strand for every nucleotide read in the DNA strand. The translation to protein is a bit more complex because three mRNA nucleotides correspond to one amino acid in the polypeptide sequence. However, the translation to protein is still systematic and <term id="term-00002">colinear</term>, such that nucleotides 1 to 3 correspond to amino acid 1, nucleotides 4 to 6 correspond to amino acid 2, and so on.</para>

<title>The Genetic Code Is Degenerate and Universal</title>
<para id="fs-id1290387">Given the different numbers of “letters” in the mRNA and protein “alphabets,” scientists theorized that combinations of nucleotides corresponded to single amino acids. Nucleotide doublets would not be sufficient to specify every amino acid because there are only 16 possible two-nucleotide combinations (4<sup>2</sup>). In contrast, there are 64 possible nucleotide triplets (4<sup>3</sup>), which is far more than the number of amino acids. Scientists theorized that amino acids were encoded by nucleotide triplets and that the genetic code was <term id="term-00003">degenerate</term>. In other words, a given amino acid could be encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet. This was later confirmed experimentally; Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner used the chemical mutagen proflavin to insert one, two, or three nucleotides into the gene of a virus. When one or two nucleotides were inserted, protein synthesis was completely abolished. When three nucleotides were inserted, the protein was synthesized and functional. This demonstrated that three nucleotides specify each amino acid. These nucleotide triplets are called <term id="term-00004">codons</term>. The insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet <term id="term-00005">reading frame</term>, thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid (<link target-id="fig-ch15_01_05"/>). Though insertion of three nucleotides caused an extra amino acid to be inserted during translation, the integrity of the rest of the protein was maintained.</para>

<para id="fs-id1634383">In addition to instructing the addition of a specific amino acid to a polypeptide chain, three of the 64 codons terminate protein synthesis and release the polypeptide from the translation machinery. These triplets are called <term id="term-00006">nonsense codons</term>, or stop codons. Another codon, AUG, also has a special function. In addition to specifying the amino acid methionine, it also serves as the start codon to initiate translation. The reading frame for translation is set by the AUG start codon near the 5' end of the mRNA.</para>
<para id="fs-id913366">The genetic code is universal. With a few exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for protein synthesis. Conservation of codons means that a purified mRNA encoding the globin protein in horses could be transferred to a tulip cell, and the tulip would synthesize horse globin. That there is only one genetic code is powerful evidence that all of life on Earth shares a common origin, especially considering that there are about 10<sup>84</sup> possible combinations of 20 amino acids and 64 triplet codons.</para>

<caption>Do you think that a kiwi or a strawberry has more DNA per fruit? (credit “kiwi”: "Kelbv"/Flickr; credit: “strawberry”: Alisdair McDiarmid)</caption></figure><para id="eip-id2896007"><emphasis effect="bold">Question</emphasis>: Would a kiwifruit and strawberry that are approximately the same size (<link target-id="fig-ch15_01_03"/>) also have approximately the same amount of DNA?</para>
<para id="eip-id1416267"><emphasis effect="bold">Background</emphasis>: Genes are carried on chromosomes and are made of DNA. All mammals are diploid, meaning they have two copies of each chromosome. However, not all plants are diploid. The common strawberry is octoploid (8<emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis>) and the cultivated kiwi is hexaploid (6<emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis>). Research the total number of chromosomes in the cells of each of these fruits and think about how this might correspond to the amount of DNA in these fruits’ cell nuclei. Read about the technique of DNA isolation to understand how each step in the isolation protocol helps liberate and precipitate DNA.</para>
<para id="eip-id1407858"><emphasis effect="bold">Hypothesis</emphasis>: Hypothesize whether you would be able to detect a difference in DNA quantity from similarly sized strawberries and kiwis. Which fruit do you think would yield more DNA?</para>
<para id="eip-id2117311"><emphasis effect="bold">Test your hypothesis</emphasis>: Isolate the DNA from a strawberry and a kiwi that are similarly sized. Perform the experiment in at least triplicate for each fruit.</para>
<list id="eip-716" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic"><item>Prepare a bottle of DNA extraction buffer from 900 mL water, 50 mL dish detergent, and two teaspoons of table salt. Mix by inversion (cap it and turn it upside down a few times).</item>
<item>Grind a strawberry and a kiwifruit by hand in a plastic bag, or using a mortar and pestle, or with a metal bowl and the end of a blunt instrument. Grind for at least two minutes per fruit.</item>
<item>Add 10 mL of the DNA extraction buffer to each fruit, and mix well for at least one minute.</item>
<item>Remove cellular debris by filtering each fruit mixture through cheesecloth or porous cloth and into a funnel placed in a test tube or an appropriate container.</item>
<item>Pour ice-cold ethanol or isopropanol (rubbing alcohol) into the test tube. You should observe white, precipitated DNA.</item>
<item>Gather the DNA from each fruit by winding it around separate glass rods.</item></list>

<para id="eip-id2024898">
<emphasis effect="bold">Record your observations</emphasis>: Because you are not quantitatively measuring DNA volume, you can record for each trial whether the two fruits produced the same or different amounts of DNA as observed by eye. If one or the other fruit produced noticeably more DNA, record this as well. Determine whether your observations are consistent with several pieces of each fruit.</para>
<para id="eip-id1463552"><emphasis effect="bold">Analyze your data</emphasis>: Did you notice an obvious difference in the amount of DNA produced by each fruit? Were your results reproducible?</para>
<para id="eip-id1458204"><emphasis effect="bold">Draw a conclusion</emphasis>: Given what you know about the number of chromosomes in each fruit, can you conclude that chromosome number necessarily correlates to DNA amount? Can you identify any drawbacks to this procedure? If you had access to a laboratory, how could you standardize your comparison and make it more quantitative?</para>

<section id="fs-id2476108" class="summary ost-reading-discard"> <title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-id3086772">The genetic code refers to the DNA alphabet (A, T, C, G), the RNA alphabet (A, U, C, G), and the polypeptide alphabet (20 amino acids). The Central Dogma describes the flow of genetic information in the cell from genes to mRNA to proteins. Genes are used to make mRNA by the process of transcription; mRNA is used to synthesize proteins by the process of translation. The genetic code is degenerate because 64 triplet codons in mRNA specify only 20 amino acids and three nonsense codons. Almost every species on the planet uses the same genetic code.</para>

<problem id="fs-id1164968577753">
<para id="fs-id1164968706332">Gamow (1954) proposed that the structure of DNA deduced by Watson and Crick (1953) could be interpreted as a way of forming roughly 20 "words" of the common amino acids from the four "letters" A, T, C, and G that represent DNA nucleotides.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164966455420">Crick and coworkers (1961) used a method developed by Benzer to induce mutations in the DNA of a virus by the insertion of a single nucleotide.  The mutant could not infect the bacterium <emphasis effect="italics">Escherichia coli</emphasis> and neither could viruses with a second insertion of a second DNA nucleotide. However, a third nucleotide insertion restored the ability of the virus to infect the bacterium.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164966343824">In 1961, Nirenberg and Matthaei conducted a series of experiments to better understand the flow of genetic information from gene to protein. They discovered that in solutions containing the contents of ruptured <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis> bacterial cells from which DNA had been removed, polymers containing only one repeating amino acid, phenylalanine, would be synthesized if synthetic mRNA composed of only the single nucleotide, uracil (U), was added to the solution in which phenylalanine was also present.  In solutions containing mRNA with only adenine (A) or cytosine (C) and the amino acids lysine or proline, polymers containing only these amino acids would be synthesized.  The researchers found that when ribosomes were removed by filtration, these polymers did not form.  Nirenberg and Leder (1964) extended this work to include other nucleotides.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164968599977">Khorana (1960) developed a technique for synthesizing RNA composed of predictable distributions of repeated pairs or triplets of nucleotides.  He found, for example, that RNA synthesized when A and U were present in relative concentrations of 4:1, respectively, will produce RNA sequences with these distributions determined by their relative probabilities: AAU:AAA, AUA:AAA, and UAA:AAA; 0.8<sup>2</sup> × 0.2/0.8<sup>3</sup> = 1/4 [calculated as follows: i) 4/5 of the bases are A, so the likelihood of selecting A is 0.8; ii) the selection is repeated to determine the second letter of the three-letter codon; iii) the likelihood of selecting a U is 1 in 5; iv) the probability of selecting the set AUU is the product; v) similarly, the probability of AAA is (4/5)<sup>3</sup>; and vi) the ratio of these probabilities is their relative likelihood]: AUU:AAA, UUA:AAA, and UAU:AAA; 0.8 × 0.2<sup>2</sup>/0.8<sup>3</sup> = 1/16; and UUU:AAA; 0.2<sup>3</sup>/0.8<sup>3</sup> = 1/64.</para>
