<para id="fs-id1167063503549">Adenosine triphosphate or ATP is the energy currency or carrier of the cell. When cells require an input of energy, they use ATP. An ATP nucleotide molecule consists of a five-carbon sugar, the nitrogenous base adenine, and three phosphate groups. (Do not confuse ATP with the nucleotides of DNA and RNA, although they have structural similarities.) The bonds that connect the phosphate have high-energy content, and the energy released from the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP + P<sub>i</sub> (Adenosine Diphosphate + phosphate) is used to perform cellular work, such as contracting a muscle or pumping a solute across a cell membrane in active transport. Cells use ATP by coupling the exergonic reaction of ATP hydrolysis with endergonic reactions, with ATP donating its phosphate group to another molecule via a process called phosphorylation. The phosphorylated molecule is at a higher energy state and is less stable than its unphosphorylated form and free energy is released to substrates to perform work during this process. Phosphorylation is an example of energy transfer between molecules.</para><para id="fs-id1167063730487" class="ost-reading-discard">Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined in Big Idea 2 of the AP<sup>®</sup> Biology Curriculum Framework.

<para id="fs-id1167066847650">It is easy to say that ATP carries energy and transfers it to chemicals to fuel reactions. The hard part is in answering the question, how? All three phosphates are negatively charged and naturally repel each other. Energy is needed to keep them together. Line them up and the repelling forces increase and makes it difficult to get the third phosphate attached. This requires much more energy and creates an unstable bond. Energy is stored in this easily broken bond and can be passed on when the third phosphate is used to phosphorylate another compound. It brings the energy with it and losses some in the transfer, creating wasted energy as heat.</para>

<para id="fs-id2155409">Even exergonic, energy-releasing reactions require a small amount of activation energy in order to proceed. However, consider endergonic reactions, which require much more energy input, because their products have more free energy than their reactants. Within the cell, where does energy to power such reactions come from? The answer lies with an energy-supplying molecule called <term id="term-00001">adenosine triphosphate</term>, or <term id="term-00002">ATP</term>. ATP is a small, relatively simple molecule (<link target-id="fs-id1167067148019"/>), but within some of its bonds, it contains the potential for a quick burst of energy that can be harnessed to perform cellular work. This molecule can be thought of as the primary energy currency of cells in much the same way that money is the currency that people exchange for things they need. ATP is used to power the majority of energy-requiring cellular reactions.</para><figure id="fs-id1167067148019" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch06-s03-lo01 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch06-s04-aplo-2-1"><media id="fs-id1870581" alt="The molecular structure of adenosine triphosphate is shown.

<para id="fs-id1467282">As its name suggests, adenosine triphosphate is comprised of adenosine bound to three phosphate groups (<link target-id="fs-id1167067148019"/>). Adenosine is a nucleoside consisting of the nitrogenous base adenine and a five-carbon sugar, ribose. The three phosphate groups, in order of closest to furthest from the ribose sugar, are labeled alpha, beta, and gamma. Together, these chemical groups constitute an energy powerhouse. However, not all bonds within this molecule exist in a particularly high-energy state. Both bonds that link the phosphates are equally high-energy bonds (<term id="term-00003">phosphoanhydride bonds</term>) that, when broken, during chemical reactions can release sufficient energy to power a variety of cellular reactions and processes. These high-energy bonds are the bonds between the second and third (or beta and gamma) phosphate groups and between the first and second phosphate groups. The reason that these bonds are considered “high-energy” is because the products of hydrolysis—adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and one inorganic phosphate group (P<sub>i</sub>)—have considerably lower free energy than the reactants: ATP and a water molecule. In other words, ATP is hydrolyzed into ADP in the following reaction:</para><equation id="eip-628"><m:math display="block">

        </m:mrow></m:math></equation><para id="fs-id1780567">Two prominent questions remain with regard to the use of ATP as an energy source. Exactly how much free energy is released with the hydrolysis of ATP, and how is that free energy used to do cellular work? The calculated ∆G  for the hydrolysis of one mole of ATP into ADP and P<sub>i</sub> is −7.3 kcal/mole (−30.5 kJ/mol). Since this calculation is true under standard conditions, it would be expected that a different value exists under cellular conditions. In fact, the ∆G  for the hydrolysis of one mole of ATP in a living cell is almost double the value at standard conditions: -14 kcal/mol (−57 kJ/mol).</para><para id="fs-id2018833">ATP is a highly unstable molecule. Unless quickly used to perform work, ATP spontaneously dissociates into ADP + P<sub>i</sub>, and the free energy released during this process is lost as heat. The second question posed above, that is, how the energy released by ATP hydrolysis is used to perform work inside the cell, depends on a strategy called <term id="term-00004">energy coupling</term>. Cells couple the exergonic reaction of ATP hydrolysis with endergonic reactions, allowing them to proceed. One example of energy coupling using ATP involves a transmembrane ion pump that is extremely important for cellular function. This sodium-potassium pump (Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump) drives sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell (<link target-id="fs-id1167066807541"/>). A large percentage of a cell’s ATP is spent powering this pump, because cellular processes bring a great deal of sodium into the cell and potassium out of the cell. The pump works constantly to stabilize cellular concentrations of sodium and potassium. In order for the pump to turn one cycle (exporting three Na+ ions and importing two K<sup>+</sup> ions), one molecule of ATP must be hydrolyzed. When ATP is hydrolyzed, its gamma phosphate doesn’t simply float away, but is actually transferred onto the pump protein. This process of a phosphate group binding to a molecule is called phosphorylation. As with most cases of ATP hydrolysis, a phosphate from ATP is transferred onto another molecule. In a phosphorylated state, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump has more free energy and is triggered to undergo a conformational change. This change allows it to release Na<sup>+</sup> to the outside of the cell. It then binds extracellular K<sup>+</sup>, which, through another conformational change, causes the phosphate to detach from the pump. This release of phosphate triggers the K<sup>+</sup> to be released to the inside of the cell. Essentially, the energy released from the hydrolysis of ATP is coupled with the energy required to power the pump and transport Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions. Once again, the ATP hydrolysis releases energy used for phosphorylation of another molecule, creating an unstable intermediate that powers the conformational change. In this way, ATP performs cellular work using this basic form of energy coupling through phosphorylation.</para><note id="fs-id2581828" class="visual-connection ost-assessed-feature"><label>Visual Connection</label>

</note><para id="fs-id1242488">Often during cellular metabolic reactions, such as the synthesis and breakdown of nutrients, certain molecules must be altered slightly in their conformation to become substrates for the next step in the reaction series. One example is during the very first steps of cellular respiration, when a molecule of the sugar glucose is broken down in the process of glycolysis. In the first step of this process, ATP is required for the phosphorylation of glucose, creating a high-energy but unstable intermediate. This phosphorylation reaction powers a conformational change that allows the phosphorylated glucose molecule to be converted to the phosphorylated sugar fructose. Fructose is a necessary intermediate for glycolysis to move forward. Here, the exergonic reaction of ATP hydrolysis is coupled with the endergonic reaction of converting glucose into a phosphorylated intermediate in the pathway. Once again, the energy released by breaking a phosphate bond within ATP was used for the phosphorylation of another molecule, creating an unstable intermediate and powering an important conformational change.</para>
