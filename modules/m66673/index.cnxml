<title>Human Reproductive Anatomy</title>
<para id="fs-idm38939952">The reproductive tissues of male and female humans develop similarly <emphasis effect="italics">in utero</emphasis> until, in some cases, a low level of the hormone testosterone is released from gonads. Testosterone causes the undeveloped tissues to differentiate into organs, such as the scrotum and penis. When testosterone is absent, the tissues continue to develop into structures such as the ovaries and labia. These cells are considered bipotential: one group of cells has the potential to develop into either type of reproductive structure. Primitive gonads become testes or ovaries. Tissues that produce a penis in males produce a clitoris in females. The tissue that will become the scrotum in a male becomes the labia in a female; that is, they are homologous structures.</para>

<title>Male Reproductive Anatomy</title>
<para id="fs-idm100461312">In the male reproductive system, the <term id="term-00001">scrotum</term> houses the testicles or testes (singular: testis), including providing passage for blood vessels, nerves, and muscles related to testicular function. The <term id="term-00002">testes</term> are a pair of male reproductive organs that produce sperm and some reproductive hormones. Each testis is approximately 2.5 by 3.8 cm (1.5 by 1 in.) in size and divided into wedge-shaped lobules by connective tissue called septa. Coiled in each wedge are seminiferous tubules that produce sperm.</para>
<para id="fs-idp134988688">Sperm are immobile at body temperature; therefore, the scrotum and penis are external to the body, as illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch43_03_01"/> so that a proper temperature is maintained for motility. In land mammals, the pair of testes must be suspended outside the body at about 2<sup>°</sup> C lower than body temperature to produce viable sperm. Infertility can occur in land mammals when the testes do not descend through the abdominal cavity during fetal development.</para>

The walls of the seminiferous tubules are made up of the developing sperm cells, with the least developed sperm at the periphery of the tubule and the fully developed sperm in the lumen. The sperm cells are mixed with “nursemaid” cells called Sertoli cells which protect the germ cells and promote their development. Other cells mixed in the wall of the tubules are the interstitial cells of Leydig. These cells produce high levels of testosterone once the male reaches adolescence.</para>
<para id="fs-idm101337088">When the sperm have developed flagella and are nearly mature, they leave the testicles and enter the epididymis, shown in <link target-id="fig-ch43_03_01"/>. This structure resembles a comma and lies along the top and posterior portion of the testes; it is the site of sperm maturation. The sperm leave the epididymis and enter the vas deferens (or ductus deferens), which carries the sperm, behind the bladder, and forms the ejaculatory duct with the duct from the seminal vesicles. During a vasectomy, a section of the vas deferens is removed, preventing sperm from being passed out of the body during ejaculation and preventing fertilization.</para>
<para id="fs-idp844928"><term id="term-00004">Semen</term> is a mixture of sperm and spermatic duct secretions (about 10 percent of the total) and fluids from accessory glands that contribute most of the semen’s volume. Sperm are haploid cells, consisting of a flagellum as a tail, a neck that contains the cell’s energy-producing mitochondria, and a head that contains the genetic material. <link target-id="fig-ch43_03_02"/> shows a micrograph of human sperm as well as a diagram of the parts of the sperm. An acrosome is found at the top of the head of the sperm.

These are the seminal vesicles, the prostate gland, and the bulbourethral gland, all of which are illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch43_03_01"/>. The <term id="term-00005">seminal vesicles</term> are a pair of glands that lie along the posterior border of the urinary bladder. The glands make a solution that is thick, yellowish, and alkaline. As sperm are only motile in an alkaline environment, a basic pH is important to reverse the acidity of the vaginal environment. The solution also contains mucus, fructose (a sperm mitochondrial nutrient), a coagulating enzyme, ascorbic acid, and local-acting hormones called prostaglandins. The seminal vesicle glands account for 60 percent of the bulk of semen.</para>
<para id="fs-idm128394416">The <term id="term-00006">penis</term>, illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch43_03_01"/>, is an organ that drains urine from the renal bladder and functions as a copulatory organ during intercourse. The penis contains three tubes of erectile tissue running through the length of the organ. These consist of a pair of tubes on the dorsal side, called the corpus cavernosum, and a single tube of tissue on the ventral side, called the corpus spongiosum. This tissue will become engorged with blood, becoming erect and hard, in preparation for intercourse. The organ is inserted into the vagina culminating with an ejaculation. During intercourse, the smooth muscle sphincters at the opening to the renal bladder close and prevent urine from entering the penis. An orgasm is a two-stage process: first, glands and accessory organs connected to the testes contract, then semen (containing sperm) is expelled through the urethra during ejaculation. After intercourse, the blood drains from the erectile tissue and the penis becomes flaccid.</para>
<para id="fs-idm44810000">The walnut-shaped <term id="term-00007">prostate gland</term> surrounds the urethra, the connection to the urinary bladder. It has a series of short ducts that directly connect to the urethra. The gland is a mixture of smooth muscle and glandular tissue. The muscle provides much of the force needed for ejaculation to occur. The glandular tissue makes a thin, milky fluid that contains citrate (a nutrient), enzymes, and prostate specific antigen (PSA). PSA is a proteolytic enzyme that helps to liquefy the ejaculate several minutes after release from the male. Prostate gland secretions account for about 30 percent of the bulk of semen.</para>
<para id="fs-idm28053856">The <term id="term-00008">bulbourethral gland</term>, or Cowper’s gland, releases its secretion prior to the release of the bulk of the semen. It neutralizes any acid residue in the urethra left over from urine. This usually accounts for a couple of drops of fluid in the total ejaculate and may contain a few sperm. Withdrawal of the penis from the vagina before ejaculation to prevent pregnancy may not work if sperm are present in the bulbourethral gland secretions.

<title>Female Reproductive Anatomy</title>
<para id="fs-idp97945664">A number of reproductive structures are exterior to the female’s body. These include the breasts and the vulva, which consists of the mons pubis, clitoris, labia majora, labia minora, and the vestibular glands, all illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch43_03_03"/>. The location and functions of the female reproductive organs are summarized in <link target-id="tab-ch43_03_02"/>. The vulva is an area associated with the vestibule which includes the structures found in the inguinal (groin) area. The mons pubis is a round, fatty area that overlies the pubic symphysis. The <term id="term-00009">clitoris</term> is a structure with erectile tissue that contains a large number of sensory nerves and serves as a source of stimulation during intercourse. The <term id="term-00010">labia majora</term> are a pair of elongated folds of tissue that run posterior from the mons pubis and enclose the other components of the vulva. The labia majora derive from the same tissue that produces the scrotum in a male. The <term id="term-00011">labia minora</term> are thin folds of tissue centrally located within the labia majora. These labia protect the openings to the vagina and urethra. The mons pubis and the anterior portion of the labia majora become covered with hair during adolescence; the labia minora is hairless.

<para id="fs-idm28639328">The breasts consist of mammary glands and fat. The size of the breast is determined by the amount of fat deposited behind the gland. Each gland consists of 15 to 25 lobes that have ducts that empty at the nipple and that supply the nursing child with nutrient- and antibody-rich milk to aid development and protect the child.</para>
<para id="fs-idm133662032">Internal female reproductive structures include ovaries, oviducts, the <term id="term-00012">uterus</term>, and the vagina, shown in <link target-id="fig-ch43_03_03"/>. The pair of ovaries is held in place in the abdominal cavity by a system of ligaments. Ovaries consist of a medulla and cortex: the medulla contains nerves and blood vessels to supply the cortex with nutrients and remove waste. The outer layers of cells of the cortex are the functional parts of the ovaries. The cortex is made up of follicular cells that surround eggs that develop during fetal development <emphasis effect="italics">in utero</emphasis>. During the menstrual period, a batch of follicular cells develops and prepares the eggs for release. At ovulation, one follicle ruptures and one egg is released, as illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch43_03_04"/>a.</para>

The central part of the ovary is the medulla, and the outer part is the cortex. Follicles exist in the cortex. Small, immature follicles are located near this stem-like structure. As a follicle matures, it grows and moves toward the edge of the ovary opposite the stem, it ruptures, releasing the egg. The follicle is now called a corpus luteum. The corpus luteum matures and moves back toward the stem, along the opposite edge of the ovary from which the follicle matured. The corpus luteum shrinks and eventually disintegrates.

The lateral ends of the oviducts flare out into a trumpet-like structure and have a fringe of finger-like projections called fimbriae, illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch43_03_03"/>b. When an egg is released at ovulation, the fimbrae help the nonmotile egg enter into the tube and passage to the uterus. The walls of the oviducts are ciliated and are made up mostly of smooth muscle. The cilia beat toward the middle, and the smooth muscle contracts in the same direction, moving the egg toward the uterus. Fertilization usually takes place within the oviducts and the developing embryo is moved toward the uterus for development. It usually takes the egg or embryo a week to travel through the oviduct. Sterilization in females is called a tubal ligation; it is analogous to a vasectomy in males in that the oviducts are severed and sealed.</para>
<para id="fs-idm129111088">The uterus is a structure about the size of a woman’s fist. This is lined with an endometrium rich in blood vessels and mucus glands. The uterus supports the developing embryo and fetus during gestation. The thickest portion of the wall of the uterus is made of smooth muscle. Contractions of the smooth muscle in the uterus aid in passing the baby through the vagina during labor. A portion of the lining of the uterus sloughs off during each menstrual period, and then builds up again in preparation for an implantation. Part of the uterus, called the cervix, protrudes into the top of the vagina. The cervix functions as the birth canal.</para>

<title>Sexual Response during Intercourse</title>
<para id="fs-idp58744592">The sexual response in humans is both psychological and physiological. People with testes-based or ovary-based reproductive systems experience sexual arousal through psychological and physical stimulation. There are four phases of the sexual response. During phase one, called excitement, vasodilation leads to vasocongestion in erectile tissues. The nipples, clitoris, labia, and penis engorge with blood and become enlarged. Vaginal secretions are released to lubricate the vagina to facilitate intercourse. During the second phase, called the plateau, stimulation continues, the outer third of the vaginal wall enlarges with blood, and breathing and heart rate increase.</para>
<para id="fs-idm145057744">During phase three, or orgasm, rhythmic, involuntary contractions of muscles occur. In the male, the reproductive accessory glands and tubules constrict placing semen in the urethra, then the urethra contracts expelling the semen through the penis. In the female, the uterus and vaginal muscles contract in waves that may last slightly less than a second each. During phase four, or resolution, the processes described in the first three phases reverse themselves and return to their normal state. Males experience a refractory period in which they cannot maintain an erection or ejaculate for a period of time ranging from minutes to hours.</para>

The cell divides unequally, with most of the cellular material and organelles going to one cell, called a secondary oocyte, and only one set of chromosomes and a small amount of cytoplasm going to the other cell. This second cell is called a polar body and usually dies. A secondary meiotic arrest occurs, this time at the metaphase II stage. At ovulation, this secondary oocyte will be released and travel toward the uterus through the oviduct.

<para id="fs-idm10611728">In phase one (excitement), vasodilation leads to vasocongestion and enlargement of erectile tissues. Vaginal secretions are released to lubricate the vagina during intercourse. In phase two (plateau), stimulation continues, the outer third of the vaginal wall enlarges with blood, and breathing and heart rate increase. In phase three (orgasm), rhythmic, involuntary contractions of muscles occur. In the male, reproductive accessory glands and tubules constrict, depositing semen in the urethra; then, the urethra contracts, expelling the semen through the penis. In women, the uterus and vaginal muscles contract in waves that may last slightly less than a second each. In phase four (resolution), the processes listed in the first three phases reverse themselves and return to their normal state. Men experience a refractory period in which they cannot maintain an erection or ejaculate for a period of time ranging from minutes to hours. Women do not experience a refractory period.</para>

<para id="fs-idm14468144">Stem cells are laid down in the male during gestation and lie dormant until adolescence. Stem cells in the female increase to one to two million and enter the first meiotic division and are arrested in prophase. At adolescence, spermatogenesis begins and continues until death, producing the maximum number of sperm with each meiotic division. Oogenesis continues again at adolescence in batches of oogonia with each menstrual cycle. These oogonia finish the first meiotic division, producing a primary oocyte with most of the cytoplasm and its contents, and a second cell called a polar body containing 23 chromosomes. The second meiotic division results in a secondary oocyte and a second oocyte. At ovulation, a mature haploid egg is released. If this egg is fertilized, it finishes the second meiotic division, including the chromosomes donated by the sperm in the finished cell. This is a diploid, fertilized egg. </para>
