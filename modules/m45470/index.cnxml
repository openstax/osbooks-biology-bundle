<para id="fs-idp8170416">The seven characteristics that Mendel evaluated in his pea plants were each expressed as one of two versions, or traits. Mendel deduced from his results that each individual had two discrete copies of the characteristic that are passed individually to offspring. We now call those two copies genes, which are carried on chromosomes. The reason we have two copies of each gene is that we inherit one from each parent. In fact, it is the chromosomes we inherit and the two copies of each gene are located on paired chromosomes. Recall that in meiosis these chromosomes are separated out into haploid gametes. This separation, or segregation, of the homologous chromosomes means also that only one of the copies of the gene gets moved into a gamete. The offspring are formed when that gamete unites with one from another parent and the two copies of each gene (and chromosome) are restored.</para>
<para id="fs-idp8399888">For cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic, a diploid organism has two genetic copies that may or may not encode the same version of that characteristic. For example, one individual may carry a gene that determines white flower color and a gene that determines violet flower color. Gene variants that arise by mutation and exist at the same relative locations on homologous chromosomes are called <term>alleles</term>. Mendel examined the inheritance of genes with just two allele forms, but it is common to encounter more than two alleles for any given gene in a natural population.</para>
<section id="fs-idp91312">
<title>Phenotypes and Genotypes</title>
<para id="fs-idp353872">Two alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics. The observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its <term>phenotype</term>. An organism’s underlying genetic makeup, consisting of both the physically visible and the non-expressed alleles, is called its <term>genotype</term>. Mendel’s hybridization experiments demonstrate the difference between phenotype and genotype. For example, the phenotypes that Mendel observed in his crosses between pea plants with differing traits are connected to the diploid genotypes of the plants in the P, F<sub>1</sub>, and F<sub>2</sub> generations. We will use a second trait that Mendel investigated, seed color, as an example. Seed color is governed by a single gene with two alleles. The yellow-seed allele is dominant and the green-seed allele is recessive. When true-breeding plants were cross-fertilized, in which one parent had yellow seeds and one had green seeds, all of the F<sub>1</sub> hybrid offspring had yellow seeds. That is, the hybrid offspring were phenotypically identical to the true-breeding parent with yellow seeds. However, we know that the allele donated by the parent with green seeds was not simply lost because it reappeared in some of the F<sub>2</sub> offspring (<link target-id="fig-ch08_02_01" document=""/>). Therefore, the F<sub>1</sub> plants must have been genotypically different from the parent with yellow seeds.</para>
<para id="fs-idp100656">The P plants that Mendel used in his experiments were each homozygous for the trait he was studying. Diploid organisms that are <term>homozygous</term> for a gene have two identical alleles, one on each of their homologous chromosomes. The genotype is often written as <emphasis effect="italics">YY</emphasis> or <emphasis effect="italics">yy</emphasis>, for which each letter represents one of the two alleles in the genotype. The dominant allele is capitalized and the recessive allele is lower case. The letter used for the gene (seed color in this case) is usually related to the dominant trait (yellow allele, in this case, or “<emphasis effect="italics">Y</emphasis>”). Mendel’s parental pea plants always bred true because both produced gametes carried the same allele. When P plants with contrasting traits were cross-fertilized, all of the offspring were <term>heterozygous</term> for the contrasting trait, meaning their genotype had different alleles for the gene being examined. For example, the F<sub>1</sub> yellow plants that received a <emphasis effect="italics">Y</emphasis> allele from their yellow parent and a <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis> allele from their green parent had the genotype <emphasis effect="italics">Yy</emphasis>.</para>

After self-fertilization of these yellow pea offspring, 75 percent of the second generation offspring have yellow peas and 25 percent have green peas.

<caption>Phenotypes are physical expressions of traits that are transmitted by alleles. Capital letters represent dominant alleles and lowercase letters represent recessive alleles. The phenotypic ratios are the ratios of visible characteristics. The genotypic ratios are the ratios of gene combinations in the offspring, and these are not always distinguishable in the phenotypes.</caption></figure>

<title>Law of Dominance</title>
<para id="fs-idp8507088">Our discussion of homozygous and heterozygous organisms brings us to why the F<sub>1</sub> heterozygous offspring were identical to one of the parents, rather than expressing both alleles. In all seven pea-plant characteristics, one of the two contrasting alleles was dominant, and the other was recessive. Mendel called the dominant allele the expressed unit factor; the recessive allele was referred to as the latent unit factor. We now know that these so-called unit factors are actually genes on homologous chromosomes. For a gene that is expressed in a dominant and recessive pattern, homozygous dominant and heterozygous organisms will look identical (that is, they will have different genotypes but the same phenotype), and the traits of the recessive allele will only be observed in homozygous recessive individuals (<link target-id="tab-ch08_02_01" document=""/>).</para><table id="tab-ch08_02_01" summary="" class="top-titled">

<para id="fs-idp6144">Mendel’s <term>law of dominance</term> states that in a heterozygote, one trait will conceal the presence of another trait for the same characteristic. For example, when crossing true-breeding violet-flowered plants with true-breeding white-flowered plants, all of the offspring were violet-flowered, even though they all had one allele for violet and one allele for white. Rather than both alleles contributing to a phenotype, the dominant allele will be expressed exclusively. The recessive allele will remain latent, but will be transmitted to offspring in the same manner as that by which the dominant allele is transmitted. The recessive trait will only be expressed by offspring that have two copies of this allele (<link target-id="fig-ch08_02_02" document=""/>), and these offspring will breed true when self-crossed.</para>

<title>Monohybrid Cross and the Punnett Square</title>
<para id="fs-idp15696">When fertilization occurs between two true-breeding parents that differ by only the characteristic being studied, the process is called a <term>monohybrid</term> cross, and the resulting offspring are called monohybrids. Mendel performed seven types of monohybrid crosses, each involving contrasting traits for different characteristics. Out of these crosses, all of the F<sub>1</sub> offspring had the phenotype of one parent, and the F<sub>2</sub> offspring had a 3:1 phenotypic ratio. On the basis of these results, Mendel postulated that each parent in the monohybrid cross contributed one of two paired unit factors to each offspring, and every possible combination of unit factors was equally likely.</para>
<para id="fs-idp7191648">The results of Mendel’s research can be explained in terms of probabilities, which are mathematical measures of likelihood. The probability of an event is calculated by the number of times the event occurs divided by the total number of opportunities for the event to occur. A probability of one (100 percent) for some event indicates that it is guaranteed to occur, whereas a probability of zero (0 percent) indicates that it is guaranteed to not occur, and a probability of 0.5 (50 percent) means it has an equal chance of occurring or not occurring.</para><para id="fs-idp7192032">To demonstrate this with a monohybrid cross, consider the case of true-breeding pea plants with yellow versus green seeds. The dominant seed color is yellow; therefore, the parental genotypes were <emphasis effect="italics">YY </emphasis>for the plants with yellow seeds<emphasis effect="italics"> </emphasis>and <emphasis effect="italics">yy</emphasis> for the plants with green seeds. A <term>Punnett square</term>, devised by the British geneticist Reginald Punnett, is useful for determining probabilities because it is drawn to predict all possible outcomes of all possible random fertilization events and their expected frequencies. <link target-id="fig-ch08_02_05" document=""/> shows a Punnett square for a cross between a plant with yellow peas and one with green peas. To prepare a Punnett square, all possible combinations of the parental alleles (the genotypes of the gametes) are listed along the top (for one parent) and side (for the other parent) of a grid. The combinations of egg and sperm gametes are then made in the boxes in the table on the basis of which alleles are combining. Each box then represents the diploid genotype of a zygote, or fertilized egg. Because each possibility is equally likely, genotypic ratios can be determined from a Punnett square. If the pattern of inheritance (dominant and recessive) is known, the phenotypic ratios can be inferred as well. For a monohybrid cross of two true-breeding parents, each parent contributes one type of allele. In this case, only one genotype is possible in the F<sub>1</sub> offspring. All offspring are <emphasis effect="italics">Yy</emphasis> and have yellow seeds.</para>
<para id="fs-idp90112">When the F<sub>1 </sub>offspring are crossed with each other, each has an equal probability of contributing either a <emphasis effect="italics">Y</emphasis> or a <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis> to the F<sub>2</sub> offspring. The result is a 1 in 4 (25 percent) probability of both parents contributing a <emphasis effect="italics">Y</emphasis>, resulting in an offspring with a yellow phenotype; a 25 percent probability of parent A contributing a <emphasis effect="italics">Y</emphasis> and parent B a <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>, resulting in offspring with a yellow phenotype; a 25 percent probability of parent A contributing a <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis> and parent B a <emphasis effect="italics">Y</emphasis>, also resulting in a yellow phenotype; and a (25 percent) probability of both parents contributing a <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>, resulting in a green phenotype. When counting all four possible outcomes, there is a 3 in 4 probability of offspring having the yellow phenotype and a 1 in 4 probability of offspring having the green phenotype. This explains why the results of Mendel’s F<sub>2</sub> generation occurred in a 3:1 phenotypic ratio. Using large numbers of crosses, Mendel was able to calculate probabilities, found that they fit the model of inheritance, and use these to predict the outcomes of other crosses.</para></section>
<section id="fs-idp8393424">
<title>Law of Segregation</title>
<para id="fs-idp315728">Observing that true-breeding pea plants with contrasting traits gave rise to F<sub>1</sub> generations that all expressed the dominant trait and F<sub>2</sub> generations that expressed the dominant and recessive traits in a 3:1 ratio, Mendel proposed the <term>law of segregation</term>. This law states that paired unit factors (genes) must segregate equally into gametes such that offspring have an equal likelihood of inheriting either factor. For the F<sub>2</sub> generation of a monohybrid cross, the following three possible combinations of genotypes result: homozygous dominant, heterozygous, or homozygous recessive. Because heterozygotes could arise from two different pathways (receiving one dominant and one recessive allele from either parent), and because heterozygotes and homozygous dominant individuals are phenotypically identical, the law supports Mendel’s observed 3:1 phenotypic ratio. The equal segregation of alleles is the reason we can apply the Punnett square to accurately predict the offspring of parents with known genotypes. The physical basis of Mendel’s law of segregation is the first division of meiosis in which the homologous chromosomes with their different versions of each gene are segregated into daughter nuclei. This process was not understood by the scientific community during Mendel’s lifetime (<link target-id="fig-ch08_02_03" document=""/>).</para>

<title>Test Cross</title>
<para id="fs-idp8164432">Beyond predicting the offspring of a cross between known homozygous or heterozygous parents, Mendel also developed a way to determine whether an organism that expressed a dominant trait was a heterozygote or a homozygote. Called the <term>test cross</term>, this technique is still used by plant and animal breeders. In a test cross, the dominant-expressing organism is crossed with an organism that is homozygous recessive for the same characteristic. If the dominant-expressing organism is a homozygote, then all F<sub>1</sub> offspring will be heterozygotes expressing the dominant trait (<link target-id="fig-ch08_02_04" document=""/>). Alternatively, if the dominant-expressing organism is a heterozygote, the F<sub>1</sub> offspring will exhibit a 1:1 ratio of heterozygotes and recessive homozygotes (<link target-id="fig-ch08_02_04" document=""/>). The test cross further validates Mendel’s postulate that pairs of unit factors segregate equally.</para>
