<para id="fs-id1167066966086">Speciation explains the diversity of organisms that inhabit the Earth. Although all life shares various genetic similarities, only certain organisms combine genetic information by sexual reproduction and produce viable and fertile offspring that, in turn, can successfully reproduce. Scientists call such organisms members of a biological species. As we will study in later, changes in allele frequencies within a population over generations result in microevolution. However, macroevolution leads to the evolution of new species when populations diverge from a common ancestor and, for one reason or another, become reproductively isolated from the original population.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167063754890" class="ost-reading-discard">Speciation occurs along two main pathways: geographic separation (<emphasis>allopatric speciation</emphasis>) and through mechanisms that occur within a shared habitat (<emphasis>sympatric speciation</emphasis>). In both cases, populations become reproductively isolated. When populations become geographically isolated, the free-flow of alleles is prevented. Over time—and because of different selective pressures—the populations diverge and become genetically independent species. <emphasis>Prezygotic barriers</emphasis> block reproduction prior to formation of a zygote, whereas <emphasis>postzygotic barriers</emphasis> block reproduction after fertilization occurs. Obviously, if two populations are separated by a vast ocean, they will not come in contact with each other to reproduce. However, if speciation has occurred, even when brought back together, they will retain their species identity. There are many examples of this in nature, including Darwin’s finches, northern and Mexican spotted owls, and Hawaiian honeycreeper. <emphasis>Adaptive radiation</emphasis> occurs when a single ancestral species gives rise to many new species. This may occur, for example, when new habitats become available. It can also be seen historically in the rise of mammals following the extinction of dinosaurs. Other examples of prezygotic isolating mechanisms include mating seasons and unique courtship behaviors. Sometimes mating occurs between two different species, resulting in a <emphasis>hybrid</emphasis> such as the mule, which is a cross between a horse and a donkey. However, most hybrids are inviable or sterile.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167067098884"><emphasis>Sympatric speciation</emphasis> does not require a geographic barrier and explains how many different species can inhabit the same area. One form of sympatric speciation begins with a serious chromosomal error during cell division. As you recall from our exploration of meiosis, sometimes errors occur in the separation of chromosomes or chromatids, resulting in gametes with extra chromosomes (<emphasis>polyploidy</emphasis>). This type of speciation is more common in plants than in animals, though some examples in animals exist. For example, two groups of cichlid fish in Africa’s Lake Victoria, which have distinct morphologies and diets, may be in the early stage of sympatric speciation without polyploidy, as genetic differences arise between the two groups.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167066810352">The word species means “kind” in Latin. In daily life, we commonly distinguish between kinds of organisms strictly by using the criteria of appearance. Differentiating between kinds of organisms on the basis of bodily form (or morphology) is, of course, both a useful and practical thing to do. As it turns out, it is also largely in line with other means (physiological traits, biochemical patterns, and DNA sequences) of biological differentiation.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167067102345">The definition of species as a group of individuals whose members have the potential to interbreed and produce viable, fertile offspring is known as the <emphasis effect="italics">biological species concept</emphasis>. Inherent in this concept of species as populations of reproductively compatible individuals is the related concept of speciation as dependent on reproductive isolation. While this definition of species depends on ideas of separateness, other definitions depend on ideas of unity. For example, the <emphasis effect="italics">ecological species concept</emphasis> defines species as a set of organisms adapted to a singular niche. In the <emphasis effect="italics">phylogenetic species concept</emphasis>, a species is defined as the smallest cluster of individuals within which there is a pattern of ancestry and descent.</para>

<title>Species and the Ability to Reproduce</title>
<para id="fs-idm16575136">A species is a group of individual organisms that interbreed and produce fertile, viable offspring. According to this definition, one species is distinguished from another when, in nature, it is not possible for matings between individuals from each species to produce fertile offspring.</para>
<para id="fs-idm96224336">Members of the same species share both external and internal characteristics, which develop from their DNA. The closer relationship two organisms share, the more DNA they have in common, just like people and their families. People’s DNA is likely to be more like their father or mother’s DNA than their cousin or grandparent’s DNA. Organisms of the same species have the highest level of DNA alignment and therefore share characteristics and behaviors that lead to successful reproduction.</para>
<para id="fs-idm101726640">Species’ appearance can be misleading in suggesting an ability or inability to mate. For example, even though domestic dogs (<emphasis effect="italics">Canis lupus familiaris</emphasis>) display phenotypic differences, such as size, build, and coat, most dogs can interbreed and produce viable puppies that can mature and sexually reproduce (<link target-id="fig-ch18_02_01"/>).</para>

For example, even though bald eagles (<emphasis effect="italics">Haliaeetus leucocephalus</emphasis>) and African fish eagles (<emphasis effect="italics">Haliaeetus vocifer</emphasis>) are both birds and eagles, each belongs to a separate species group (<link target-id="fig-ch18_02_02"/>). If humans were to artificially intervene and fertilize the egg of a bald eagle with the sperm of an African fish eagle and a chick did hatch, that offspring, called a hybrid	 (a cross between two species), would probably be infertile—unable to successfully reproduce after it reached maturity. Different species may have different genes that are active in development; therefore, it may not be possible to develop a viable offspring with two different sets of directions. Thus, even though hybridization may take place, the two species still remain separate.</para>

Again, the basis to any changes in a group or population of organisms must be genetic for this is the only way to share and pass on traits. When variations occur within a species, they can only be passed to the next generation along two main pathways: asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction. The change will be passed on asexually simply if the reproducing cell possesses the changed trait. For the changed trait to be passed on by sexual reproduction, a gamete, such as a sperm or egg cell, must possess the changed trait.  In other words, sexually-reproducing organisms can experience several genetic changes in their body cells, but if these changes do not occur in a sperm or egg cell, the changed trait will never reach the next generation. Only heritable traits can evolve. Therefore, reproduction plays a paramount role for genetic change to take root in a population or species. In short, organisms must be able to reproduce with each other to pass new traits to offspring.</para>

<title>Speciation</title>
<para id="fs-idm99888736">The biological definition of species, which works for sexually reproducing organisms, is a group of actually or potentially interbreeding individuals. There are exceptions to this rule. Many species are similar enough that hybrid offspring are possible and may often occur in nature, but for the majority of species this rule generally holds. In fact, the presence in nature of hybrids between similar species suggests that they may have descended from a single interbreeding species, and the speciation process may not yet be complete.</para><para id="fs-idm101597488">Given the extraordinary diversity of life on the planet there must be mechanisms for <emphasis>speciation</emphasis>: the formation of two species from one original species. Darwin envisioned this process as a branching event and diagrammed the process in the only illustration found in <emphasis effect="italics">On the</emphasis> <emphasis effect="italics">Origin of Species</emphasis> (<link target-id="fig-ch18_02_03"/><emphasis effect="bold">a</emphasis>). Compare this illustration to the diagram of elephant evolution (<link target-id="fig-ch18_02_03"/><emphasis effect="bold">b</emphasis>), which shows that as one species changes over time, it branches to form more than one new species, repeatedly, as long as the population survives or until the organism becomes extinct.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch18_02_03"><media id="fs-idm103229696" alt="Image (a) shows a sketch of lines branching into a tree shape. At the bottom are 11 vertical lines labeled A through L. These then are branched out as they move up across the page through fourteen rows labeled with Roman numerals. Some branches make a straight line from the bottom row to the top row, others keep branching out further at each row, and some are straight partway through the rows until they connect to an existing branch or form no connection and instead stop. The top four rows each consists of a single line from a branch tip (there are 6 branch tips at row XI) to one of 15 individual final designations. Illustration B shows the evolution of modern African and Asian elephants from a common ancestor, the Palaeomastodon. The Palaeomastodon was similar to modern elephants; however, it was smaller and had a long nose instead of a trunk. Side branches of the elephant evolutionary tree gave rise to mastodons and mammoths. The mammoth is more closely related to modern elephants than the mastodon.">

<caption>The only illustration in Darwin's <emphasis effect="italics">On the Origin of Species</emphasis> is (a) a diagram showing speciation events leading to biological diversity. The diagram shows similarities to phylogenetic charts that are drawn today to illustrate the relationships of species. (b) Modern elephants evolved from the <emphasis effect="italics">Palaeomastodon</emphasis>, a species that lived in Egypt 35–50 million years ago.</caption></figure><para id="fs-idm103124960">For speciation to occur, two new populations must be formed from one original population and they must evolve in such a way that it becomes impossible for individuals from the two new populations to interbreed. Biologists have proposed mechanisms by which this could occur that fall into two broad categories. Allopatric speciation (allo- = "other"; -patric = "homeland") involves geographic separation of populations from a parent species and subsequent evolution. Sympatric speciation (sym- = "same"; -patric = "homeland") involves speciation occurring within a parent species remaining in one location.</para>
<para id="fs-idm143545712">Biologists think of speciation events as the splitting of one ancestral species into two descendant species. There is no reason why there might not be more than two species formed at one time except that it is less likely and multiple events can be conceptualized as single splits occurring close in time.</para>

<title>Allopatric Speciation</title>
<para id="fs-idm85041232">A geographically continuous population has a gene pool that is relatively homogeneous. Gene flow, the movement of alleles across the range of the species, is relatively free because individuals can move and then mate with individuals in their new location. Thus, the frequency of an allele at one end of a distribution will be similar to the frequency of the allele at the other end. When populations become geographically discontinuous, that free-flow of alleles is prevented. When that separation lasts for a period of time, the two populations are able to evolve along different trajectories. Thus, their allele frequencies at numerous genetic loci gradually become more and more different as new alleles independently arise by mutation in each population. Typically, environmental conditions, such as climate, resources, predators, and competitors for the two populations will differ causing natural selection to favor divergent adaptations in each group.</para>
<para id="fs-idm93398672">Isolation of populations leading to allopatric speciation can occur in a variety of ways: a river forming a new branch, erosion forming a new valley, a group of organisms traveling to a new location without the ability to return, or seeds floating over the ocean to an island. The nature of the geographic separation necessary to isolate populations depends entirely on the biology of the organism and its potential for dispersal. If two flying insect populations took up residence in separate nearby valleys, chances are, individuals from each population would fly back and forth continuing gene flow. However, if two rodent populations became divided by the formation of a new lake, continued gene flow would be unlikely; therefore, speciation would be more likely.</para>
<para id="fs-idm104294672">Biologists group allopatric processes into two categories: dispersal and vicariance. <emphasis>Dispersal</emphasis> is when a few members of a species move to a new geographical area, and <emphasis>vicariance</emphasis> is when a natural situation arises to physically divide organisms.</para>
<para id="fs-idm103603056">Scientists have documented numerous cases of allopatric speciation taking place. For example, along the west coast of the United States, two separate sub-species of spotted owls exist. The northern spotted owl has genetic and phenotypic differences from its close relative: the Mexican spotted owl, which lives in the south (<link target-id="fig-ch18_02_04"/>).</para>

This seems logical because as the distance increases, the various environmental factors would likely have less in common than locations in close proximity. Consider the two owls: in the north, the climate is cooler than in the south; the types of organisms in each ecosystem differ, as do their behaviors and habits; also, the hunting habits and prey choices of the southern owls vary from the northern owls. These variances can lead to evolved differences in the owls, and speciation likely will occur.</para>

<title>Adaptive Radiation</title>
<para id="fs-idm41089472">In some cases, a population of one species disperses throughout an area, and each population finds a distinct niche or isolated habitat. Over time, the varied demands of their new lifestyles lead to multiple speciation events originating from a single species. This is called adaptive radiation because many adaptations evolve from a single point of origin; thus, causing the species to radiate into several new ones. Island archipelagos like the Hawaiian Islands provide an ideal context for adaptive radiation events because water surrounds each island which leads to geographical isolation for many organisms. The Hawaiian honeycreeper illustrates one example of adaptive radiation. From a single species, called the founder species, numerous species have evolved, including the six shown in <link target-id="fig-ch18_02_05"/>.</para>

The seed-eating bird has a thicker, stronger beak which is suited to break hard nuts. The nectar-eating birds have long beaks to dip into flowers to reach the nectar. The insect-eating birds have beaks like swords, appropriate for stabbing and impaling insects. Darwin’s finches are another example of adaptive radiation in an archipelago.</para>

<title>Sympatric Speciation</title>
<para id="fs-idm201779952">Can divergence occur if no physical barriers are in place to separate individuals who continue to live and reproduce in the same habitat? The answer is yes. The process of speciation within the same space is called sympatric speciation; the prefix “sym” means same, so “sympatric” means “same homeland” in contrast to “allopatric” meaning “other homeland.” A number of mechanisms for sympatric speciation have been proposed and studied.</para>
<para id="fs-idm174791120">One form of sympatric speciation can begin with a serious chromosomal error during cell division.

<para id="fs-idm110753248">Polyploidy is a condition in which a cell or organism has an extra set, or sets, of chromosomes. Scientists have identified two main types of polyploidy that can lead to reproductive isolation of an individual in the polyploidy state. Reproductive isolation is the inability to interbreed. In some cases, a polyploid individual will have two or more complete sets of chromosomes from its own species in a condition called <emphasis>autopolyploidy</emphasis> (<link target-id="fig-ch18_02_07"/>). The prefix “auto-” means “self,” so the term means multiple chromosomes from one’s own species. Polyploidy results from an error in meiosis in which all of the chromosomes move into one cell instead of separating.</para>

These new gametes will be incompatible with the normal gametes produced by this plant species. However, they could either self-pollinate or reproduce with other autopolyploid plants with gametes having the same diploid number. In this way, sympatric speciation can occur quickly by forming offspring with 4<emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> called a tetraploid. These individuals would immediately be able to reproduce only with those of this new kind and not those of the ancestral species.</para>
<para id="fs-idm78071504">The other form of polyploidy occurs when individuals of two different species reproduce to form a viable offspring called an <emphasis>allopolyploid</emphasis>.

With such a high rate of polyploidy in plants, some scientists hypothesize that this mechanism takes place more as an adaptation than as an error.</para>

<title>Reproductive Isolation</title>
<para id="fs-idm72065376">Given enough time, the genetic and phenotypic divergence between populations will affect characters that influence reproduction: if individuals of the two populations were to be brought together, mating would be less likely, but if mating occurred, offspring would be non-viable or infertile. Many types of diverging characters may affect the <emphasis>reproductive isolation</emphasis> (the inability to interbreed) of the two populations.</para>
<para id="fs-idm219191376">Reproductive isolation can take place in a variety of ways. Scientists organize them into two groups: prezygotic barriers and postzygotic barriers. Recall that a zygote is a fertilized egg: the first cell of the development of an organism that reproduces sexually. Therefore, a prezygotic barrier is a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place; this includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction. A postzygotic barrier occurs after zygote formation; this includes organisms that don’t survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile.</para>
<para id="fs-idm28981696">Some types of prezygotic barriers prevent reproduction entirely. Many organisms only reproduce at certain times of the year, often just annually. Differences in breeding schedules, called <emphasis>temporal isolation</emphasis>, can act as a form of reproductive isolation.

For example, a cricket population that was divided after a flood could no longer interact with each other.

<title>Habitat Influence on Speciation</title>
<para id="fs-idm120115328">Sympatric speciation may also take place in ways other than polyploidy. For example, consider a species of fish that lives in a lake. As the population grows, competition for food also grows. Under pressure to find food, suppose that a group of these fish had the genetic flexibility to discover and feed off another resource that was unused by the other fish. What if this new food source was found at a different depth of the lake? Over time, those feeding on the second food source would interact more with each other than the other fish; therefore, they would breed together as well. Offspring of these fish would likely behave as their parents: feeding and living in the same area and keeping separate from the original population. If this group of fish continued to remain separate from the first population, eventually sympatric speciation might occur as more genetic differences accumulated between them.</para>
<para id="fs-idm53402816">This scenario does play out in nature, as do others that lead to reproductive isolation. One such place is Lake Victoria in Africa, famous for its sympatric speciation of cichlid fish. Researchers have found hundreds of sympatric speciation events in these fish, which have not only happened in great number, but also over a short period of time. <link target-id="fig-ch18_02_13"/> shows this type of speciation among a cichlid fish population in Nicaragua.

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-idm19052624">Speciation occurs along two main pathways: geographic separation (allopatric speciation) and through mechanisms that occur within a shared habitat (sympatric speciation). Both pathways isolate a population reproductively in some form. Mechanisms of reproductive isolation act as barriers between closely related species, enabling them to diverge and exist as genetically independent species. Prezygotic barriers block reproduction prior to formation of a zygote, whereas postzygotic barriers block reproduction after fertilization occurs. For a new species to develop, something must cause a breach in the reproductive barriers. Sympatric speciation can occur through errors in meiosis that form gametes with extra chromosomes (polyploidy). Autopolyploidy occurs within a single species, whereas allopolyploidy occurs between closely related species.</para>
