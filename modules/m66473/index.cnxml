<para id="fs-idp15776">Photosynthesis is essential to almost all life on earth; both plants and animals depend on it. It is the only biological process that can capture energy that originates from sunlight and convert it into chemical compounds (carbohydrates) that every organism uses to power its metabolism. It is also a source of oxygen necessary for many living organisms. In brief, the energy of sunlight is “captured” to energize electrons, whose energy is then stored in the covalent bonds of sugar molecules. How long lasting and stable are those covalent bonds? The energy extracted today by the burning of coal and petroleum products represents sunlight energy captured and stored by photosynthesis 350 to 200 million years ago during the Carboniferous Period.</para>
<para id="fs-idm163325392">Plants, algae, and a group of bacteria called cyanobacteria are the only organisms capable of performing photosynthesis (<link target-id="fig-ch08_01_01"/>). Because they use light to manufacture their own food, they are called <term id="term-00001">photoautotrophs</term> (literally, “self-feeders using light”). Other organisms, such as animals, fungi, and most other bacteria, are termed <term id="term-00002">heterotrophs</term> (“other feeders”), because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs. A third very interesting group of bacteria synthesize sugars, not by using sunlight’s energy, but by extracting energy from inorganic chemical compounds. For this reason, they are referred to as <term id="term-00003">chemoautotrophs</term>.</para>

<caption>Photoautotrophs including (a) plants, (b) algae, and (c) cyanobacteria synthesize their organic compounds via photosynthesis using sunlight as an energy source. Cyanobacteria and planktonic algae can grow over enormous areas in water, at times completely covering the surface. In a (d) deep sea vent, chemoautotrophs, such as these (e) thermophilic bacteria, capture energy from inorganic compounds to produce organic compounds. The ecosystem surrounding the vents has a diverse array of animals, such as tubeworms, crustaceans, and octopuses that derive energy from the bacteria.

After all, a lizard sunning itself on a cold day can use the sun’s energy to warm up in a process called <emphasis effect="italics">behavioral thermoregulation</emphasis>. In contrast, photosynthesis is vital because it evolved as a way to <emphasis effect="italics">store the energy from solar radiation (the “photo-” part) to energy in the carbon-carbon bonds of carbohydrate molecules (the “-synthesis” part).</emphasis> Those carbohydrates are the energy source that heterotrophs use to power the synthesis of ATP via respiration. Therefore, photosynthesis powers 99 percent of Earth’s ecosystems. When a top predator, such as a wolf, preys on a deer (<link target-id="fig-ch08_01_02"/>), the wolf is at the end of an energy path that went from nuclear reactions on the surface of the sun, to visible light, to photosynthesis, to vegetation, to deer, and finally to the wolf.</para>

<title>Main Structures and Summary of Photosynthesis</title>
<para id="fs-idm107168592">Photosynthesis is a multi-step process that requires specific wavelengths of visible sunlight, carbon dioxide (which is low in energy), and water as substrates (<link target-id="fig-ch08_01_03"/>). After the process is complete, it releases oxygen and produces glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), as well as simple carbohydrate molecules (high in energy) that can then be converted into glucose, sucrose, or any of dozens of other sugar molecules. These sugar molecules contain energy and the energized carbon that all living things need to survive.</para>

<title>Basic Photosynthetic Structures</title>
<para id="fs-idm194890448">In plants, photosynthesis generally takes place in leaves, which consist of several layers of cells. The process of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the <term id="term-00004">mesophyll</term>. The gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small, regulated openings called <term id="term-00005">stomata</term> (singular: stoma), which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance. The stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf, which helps to minimize water loss due to high temperatures on the upper surface of the leaf. Each stoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response to osmotic changes.</para><para id="fs-idm56890608">In all autotrophic eukaryotes, photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a <term id="term-00006">chloroplast</term>. For plants, chloroplast-containing cells exist mostly in the mesophyll. Chloroplasts have a double membrane envelope (composed of an outer membrane and an inner membrane), and are ancestrally derived from ancient free-living cyanobacteria. Within the chloroplast are stacked, disc-shaped structures called <term id="term-00007">thylakoids</term>. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll, a <term id="term-00008">pigment</term> (molecule that absorbs light) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material, and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain. The thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the <term id="term-00009">thylakoid lumen</term>. As shown in <link target-id="fig-ch08_01_05"/>, a stack of thylakoids is called a <term id="term-00010">granum</term>, and the liquid-filled space surrounding the granum is called <term id="term-00011">stroma</term> or “bed” (not to be confused with stoma or “mouth,” an opening on the leaf epidermis).</para><note id="fs-idm18480448" class="visual-connection">

<title>The Two Parts of Photosynthesis</title>
<para id="fs-idm84258528">Photosynthesis takes place in two sequential stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions. In the <term id="term-00012">light-dependent reactions</term>, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy. In the <term id="term-00013">light-independent reactions</term>, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions drives the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. Therefore, although the light-independent reactions do not use light as a reactant, they require the products of the light-dependent reactions to function. In addition, however, several enzymes of the light-independent reactions are activated by light. The light-dependent reactions utilize certain molecules to temporarily store the energy: These are referred to as <emphasis effect="italics">energy carriers</emphasis>. The energy carriers that move energy from light-dependent reactions to light-independent reactions can be thought of as “full” because they are rich in energy. After the energy is released, the “empty” energy carriers return to the light-dependent reaction to obtain more energy. <link target-id="fig-ch08_01_06"/> illustrates the components inside the chloroplast where the light-dependent and light-independent reactions take place.</para><figure id="fig-ch08_01_06"><media id="fs-idm54375680" alt="This illustration shows a chloroplast with an outer membrane, an inner membrane, and stacks of membranes inside the inner membrane called thylakoids. The entire stack is called a granum. In the light reactions, energy from sunlight is converted into chemical energy in the form of A T P and N A D P H. In the process, water is used and oxygen is produced. Energy from A T P and N A D P H are used to power the Calvin cycle, which produces G 3 P from carbon dioxide. A T P is broken down to A D P and Pi, and N A D P H is oxidized to N A D P superscript plus sign baseline. The cycle is completed when the light reactions convert these molecules back into A T P and N A D P H.">

<caption>Foods that humans consume originate from photosynthesis. (credit: Associação Brasileira de Supermercados)</caption></figure><para id="fs-idm82036720">Major grocery stores in the United States are organized into departments, such as dairy, meats, produce, bread, cereals, and so forth. Each aisle (<link target-id="fig-ch08_01_07"/>) contains hundreds, if not thousands, of different products for customers to buy and consume.</para>
<para id="fs-idm24841808">Although there is a large variety, each item ultimately can be linked back to photosynthesis. Meats and dairy link, because the animals were fed plant-based foods. The breads, cereals, and pastas come largely from starchy grains, which are the seeds of photosynthesis-dependent plants. What about desserts and drinks? All of these products contain sugar—sucrose is a plant product, a disaccharide, a carbohydrate molecule, which is built directly from photosynthesis. Moreover, many items are less obviously derived from plants: For instance, paper goods are generally plant products, and many plastics (abundant as products and packaging) are derived from “algae” (unicellular plant-like organisms, and cyanobacteria). Virtually every spice and flavoring in the spice aisle was produced by a plant as a leaf, root, bark, flower, fruit, or stem. Ultimately, photosynthesis connects to every meal and every food a person consumes.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-idm202695168">The process of photosynthesis transformed life on Earth. By harnessing energy from the sun, the evolution of photosynthesis allowed living things access to enormous amounts of energy. Because of photosynthesis, living things gained access to sufficient energy that allowed them to build new structures and achieve the biodiversity evident today.</para>
<para id="fs-idm202694912">Only certain organisms (photoautotrophs), can perform photosynthesis; they require the presence of chlorophyll, a specialized pigment that absorbs certain wavelengths of the visible spectrum and can capture energy from sunlight. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water to assemble carbohydrate molecules and release oxygen as a byproduct into the atmosphere. Eukaryotic autotrophs, such as plants and algae, have organelles called chloroplasts in which photosynthesis takes place, and starch accumulates. In prokaryotes, such as cyanobacteria, the process is less localized and occurs within folded membranes, extensions of the plasma membrane, and in the cytoplasm.</para>
