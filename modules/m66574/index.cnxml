<para id="fs-idm2480560">From their humble and still obscure beginning during the early Jurassic period, the angiosperms—or flowering plants—have evolved to dominate most terrestrial ecosystems (<link target-id="fig-ch26_03_01" document=""/>). With more than 300,000 species, the angiosperm phylum (Anthophyta) is second only to insects in terms of diversification.</para>

<para id="fs-idp42171600">The success of angiosperms is due to two novel reproductive structures: flowers and fruits. The function of the flower is to ensure pollination, often by arthropods, as well as to protect a developing embryo. The colors and patterns on flowers offer specific signals to many pollinating insects or birds and bats that have coevolved with them. For example, some patterns are visible only in the ultraviolet range of light, which can be seen by arthropod pollinators. For some pollinators, flowers advertise themselves as a reliable source of nectar. Flower scent also helps to select its pollinators. Sweet scents tend to attract bees and butterflies and moths, but some flies and beetles might prefer scents that signal fermentation or putrefaction. Flowers also provide protection for the ovule and developing embryo inside a receptacle. The function of the fruit is seed protection and dispersal. Different fruit structures or tissues on fruit—such as sweet flesh, wings, parachutes, or spines that grab—reflect the dispersal strategies that help spread seeds.</para>

<title>Flowers</title>
<para id="fs-idm91968544">Flowers are modified leaves, or sporophylls, organized around a central receptacle. Although they vary greatly in appearance, virtually all flowers contain the same structures: sepals, petals, carpels, and stamens. The peduncle typically attaches the flower to the plant proper. A whorl of <term>sepals</term> (collectively called the <term>calyx</term>) is located at the base of the peduncle and encloses the unopened floral bud. Sepals are usually photosynthetic organs, although there are some exceptions. For example, the corolla in lilies and tulips consists of three sepals and three petals that look virtually identical. <term>Petals</term>, collectively the <term>corolla</term>, are located inside the whorl of sepals and may display vivid colors to attract pollinators. Sepals and petals together form the <term>perianth</term>. The sexual organs, the <emphasis effect="italics">female gynoecium</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">male androecium</emphasis> are located at the center of the flower. Typically, the sepals, petals, and stamens are attached to the receptacle at the base of the gynoecium, but the gynoecium may also be located deeper in the receptacle, with the other floral structures attached above it.</para>
<para id="fs-idm33765824">As illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch26_03_02" document=""/>, the innermost part of a perfect flower is the <term>gynoecium</term>, the location in the flower where the eggs will form. The female reproductive unit consists of one or more carpels, each of which has a stigma, style, and ovary. The <term>stigma</term> is the location where the pollen is deposited either by wind or a pollinating arthropod. The sticky surface of the stigma traps pollen grains, and the <term>style</term> is a connecting structure through which the pollen tube will grow to reach the ovary. The <term>ovary</term> houses one or more ovules, each of which will ultimately develop into a <term>seed</term>. Flower structure is very diverse, and carpels may be singular, multiple, or fused. (Multiple fused carpels comprise a <term>pistil</term>.) The <term>androecium</term>, or male reproductive region is composed of multiple stamens surrounding the central carpel. <term>Stamens</term> are composed of a thin stalk called a <term>filament</term> and a sac-like structure called the <term>anther</term>. The filament supports the anther, where the microspores are produced by meiosis and develop into haploid pollen grains, or male gametophytes.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch26_03_02">
<media id="fs-idm5220080" alt="Illustration shows parts of a flower, which is called the perianth. The corolla is composed of petals, and the calyx is composed of sepals. At the center of the perianth is a vase-like structure called the carpel. A flower may have one or more carpels, but the example shown has only one. The narrow neck of the carpel, called the style, widens into a flat stima at the top. The ovary is the wide part of the carpel. Ovules, or megasporangia, are clusters of pods in the middle of the ovary. The androecium is composed of stamens which cluster around the carpel. The stamen consists a long, stalk-like filament with an anther at the end. The anther shown is tri-lobed. Each lobe, called a microsporangium, is filled with pollen.">

<title>The Life Cycle of an Angiosperm</title>
<para id="fs-idm13973680">The adult or sporophyte phase is the main phase of an angiosperm’s life cycle (<link target-id="fig-ch26_03_03" document=""/>). Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are heterosporous. Therefore, they produce microspores, which will generate pollen grains as the male gametophytes, and <emphasis effect="italics">megaspores</emphasis>, which will form an ovule that contains female gametophytes. Inside the anther’s microsporangia, male sporocytes divide by meiosis to generate haploid microspores, which, in turn, undergo mitosis and give rise to pollen grains. Each pollen grain contains two cells: one generative cell that will divide into two sperm and a second cell that will become the pollen tube cell.</para>
<note id="fs-idp67544128" class="visual-connection"><label/><title>Visual Connection</title>
<figure id="fig-ch26_03_03"><media id="fs-idp39168384" alt=" The parts of the flower are shown. The base of the perianth, which includes petals and sepals, is called the flora axis. A narrowing called the articulation separates the floral axis from the lower pedicel, which attached the flower to a stem. Microsporangia are in the anthers. Microspores, or mother cells form inside the microsporangia. The microspore undergoes meiosis, producing four cells, each of which becomes a grain of pollen with a hard coating. The pollen grain undergoes mitosis, producing a generative cell and a tube cell. Macrospores form inside vase-like carpel, in the ovules, which are in the ovaries. The macrospores undergo meiosis, producing four cells. The cells then undergo mitosis, producing three antipodals, two polar nuclei, and egg and two synergids, each with a nucleus. Together, these cells are called the megagametophyte, or embryo sac. Pollination occurs when a pollen grain lands on the stigma, the flat structure at the top of the carpel. The tube nucleus grows into the long style, to the ovary. There, the generative cell of the sperm fertilizes the egg.">

If the flower lacked a microsporangium, what type of gamete would not form?</para>
<!--<para><link target-id="fig-ch26_03_03" document=""/>Without a megasporangium, an egg would not form; without a microsporangium, pollen would not form.</para>-->
</note>
<para id="fs-idp67453984">The ovule, sheltered within the ovary of the carpel, contains the megasporangium protected by two layers of integuments and the ovary wall. Within each megasporangium, a diploid megasporocyte undergoes meiosis, generating four haploid megaspores—three small and one large. Only the large megaspore survives; it divides mitotically three times to produce eight nuclei distributed among the seven cells of the female gametophyte or embryo sac. Three of these cells are located at each pole of the embryo sac. The three cells at one pole become the egg and two <emphasis effect="italics">synergids</emphasis>. The three cells at the opposite pole become antipodal cells. The center cell contains the remaining two nuclei (polar nuclei). This cell will eventually produce the endosperm of the seed. The mature embryo sac then contains one egg cell, two synergids or “helper” cells, three antipodal cells (which eventually degenerate), and a central cell with two polar nuclei. When a pollen grain reaches the stigma, a pollen tube extends from the grain, grows down the style, and enters through the micropyle: an opening in the integuments of the ovule. The two sperm are deposited in the embryo sac.</para>
<para id="fs-idm37265552">A double fertilization event then occurs. One sperm and the egg combine, forming a diploid zygote—<emphasis effect="italics">the future embryo</emphasis>. The other sperm fuses with the polar nuclei, forming a triploid cell that will develop into the <term>endosperm</term>—the tissue that serves as a food reserve for the developing embryo. The zygote develops into an embryo with a <emphasis effect="italics">radicle</emphasis>, or small root, and one (monocot) or two (dicot) leaf-like organs called <emphasis effect="italics">cotyledons</emphasis>. This difference in the number of embryonic leaves is the basis for the two major groups of angiosperms: the <emphasis effect="italics">monocots</emphasis> and the <emphasis effect="italics">eudicots</emphasis>. Seed food reserves are stored outside the embryo, in the form of complex carbohydrates, lipids, or proteins. The <term>cotyledons</term> serve as conduits to transmit the broken-down food reserves from their storage site inside the seed to the developing embryo. The seed consists of a toughened layer of integuments forming the coat, the endosperm with food reserves, and at the center, the well-protected embryo.</para>
<para id="fs-idm1559840">Most angiosperms have <term>perfect flowers</term>, which means that each flower carries both stamens and carpels (<link target-id="fig-ch26_03_03" document=""/>). In monoecious plants, male (staminate) and female (pistillate) flowers are separate, but carried on the same plant. Sweetgums (<emphasis effect="italics">Liquidambar</emphasis> spp.) and beeches (<emphasis effect="italics">Betula</emphasis> spp. are monoecious (<link target-id="fig-ch26_03_03a" document=""/>). In dioecious plants, male and female flowers are found on separate plants. Willows (<emphasis effect="italics">Salix</emphasis> spp.) and poplars (<emphasis effect="italics">Populus</emphasis> spp.) are dioecious. In spite of the predominance of perfect flowers, only a few species of angiosperms self-pollinate. Both anatomical and environmental barriers promote cross-pollination mediated by a physical agent (wind or water), or an animal, such as an insect or bird. Cross-pollination increases genetic diversity in a species.</para>

<title>Fruit</title>
<para id="fs-idm28338128">As the seed develops, the walls of the ovary thicken and form the fruit. The seed forms in an ovary, which also enlarges as the seeds grow. Many foods commonly called vegetables are actually fruits. Eggplants, zucchini, string beans, tomatoes, and bell peppers are all technically fruits because they contain seeds and are derived from the thick ovary tissue. Acorns are true nuts, and winged maple “helicopter seeds” or whirligigs (whose botanical name is <emphasis effect="italics">samara</emphasis>) are also fruits. Botanists classify fruit into more than two dozen different categories, only a few of which are actually fleshy and sweet.</para>
<para id="fs-idm38928288">Mature fruit can be fleshy or dry. <emphasis effect="italics">Fleshy fruit</emphasis> include the familiar berries, peaches, apples, grapes, and tomatoes. Rice, wheat, and nuts are examples of <emphasis effect="italics">dry fruit</emphasis>. Another subtle distinction is that not all fruits are derived from just the ovary. For instance, strawberries are derived from the ovary as well as the receptacle, and apples are formed from the ovary and the pericarp, or <emphasis effect="italics">hypanthium</emphasis>. Some fruits are derived from separate ovaries in a single flower, such as the raspberry. Other fruits, such as the pineapple, form from clusters of flowers. Additionally, some fruits, like watermelon and orange, have rinds. Regardless of how they are formed, fruits are an agent of seed dispersal. The variety of shapes and characteristics reflect the mode of dispersal. Wind carries the light dry fruits of trees and dandelions. Water transports floating coconuts. Some fruits attract herbivores with their color or scent, or as food. Once eaten, tough, undigested seeds are dispersed through the herbivore’s feces (<emphasis effect="italics">endozoochory</emphasis>). Other fruits have burrs and hooks to cling to fur and hitch rides on animals (<emphasis effect="italics">epizoochory</emphasis>).</para>

<title>Diversity of Angiosperms</title>
<para id="fs-idp29665600">Angiosperms are classified in a single phylum: the <term>Anthophyta</term>. Modern angiosperms appear to be a monophyletic group, which as you may recall means that they originated from a single ancestor. Within the angiosperms are three major groups: basal angiosperms, monocots, and dicots. Basal angiosperms are a group of plants that are believed to have branched off before the separation of the monocots and eudicots, because they exhibit traits from both groups. They are categorized separately in most classification schemes. The basal angiosperms include <emphasis effect="italics">Amborella</emphasis>, water lilies, the Magnoliids (magnolia trees, laurels, and spice peppers), and a group called the Austrobaileyales, which includes the star anise. The monocots and dicots are differentiated on the basis of the structure of the cotyledons, pollen grains, and other structures. Monocots include grasses and lilies, and the dicots form a multi-branched group that includes (among many others) roses, cabbages, sunflowers, and mints.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title>
<para id="fs-idm109253584">Angiosperms are the dominant form of plant life in most terrestrial ecosystems, comprising about 90 percent of all plant species. Most crops and ornamental plants are angiosperms. Their success comes from two innovative structures that protect reproduction from variability in the environment: the flower and the fruit. Flowers were derived from modified leaves; their color and fragrance encourages species-specific pollination. The main parts of a flower are the sepals and petals, which protect the reproductive parts: the stamens and the carpels. The stamens produce the male gametes in pollen grains. The carpels contain the female gametes (the eggs inside the ovules), which are within the ovary of a carpel. The walls of the ovary thicken after fertilization, ripening into fruit that ensures dispersal by wind, water, or animals.</para>
<para id="fs-idm47171424">The angiosperm life cycle is dominated by the sporophyte stage. Double fertilization is an event unique to angiosperms. One sperm in the pollen fertilizes the egg, forming a diploid zygote, while the other combines with the two polar nuclei, forming a triploid cell that develops into a food storage tissue called the endosperm. Flowering plants are divided into two main groups, the monocots and eudicots, according to the number of cotyledons in the seedlings. Basal angiosperms belong to an older lineage than monocots and eudicots.</para>
