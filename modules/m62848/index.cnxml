<para id="fs-id1166851172344">The Science Practice Challenge Questions contain additional test questions for this section that will help you prepare for the AP exam. These questions address the following standards:<newline/>
[APLO 3.18]</para><para id="fs-id2745728">Like prokaryotic cells, the transcription of genes in eukaryotes requires the actions of an RNA polymerase to bind to a sequence upstream of a gene to initiate transcription. However, unlike prokaryotic cells, the eukaryotic RNA polymerase requires other proteins, or transcription factors, to facilitate transcription initiation. Transcription factors are proteins that bind to the promoter sequence and other regulatory sequences to control the transcription of the target gene. RNA polymerase by itself cannot initiate transcription in eukaryotic cells. Transcription factors must bind to the promoter region first and recruit RNA polymerase to the site for transcription to be established.</para>
<para id="fs-id1166170586361">The activity of transcription factors can regulate differential gene expression in cells, resulting in the development of different cell products and functions. For example, scientists have found that primary sexual characteristics is regulated by several genes <link target-id="ep-123"/>. In the fruit fly <emphasis effect="italics">Drosophila</emphasis>, the <emphasis effect="italics">slx</emphasis> gene determines sex. This gene is expressed when the organism has two copies of the X chromosome. The gene product for <emphasis effect="italics">slx</emphasis> binds to the mRNA of the <emphasis effect="italics">tra</emphasis> gene and regulates its splicing. In the presence of <emphasis effect="italics">slx</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">tra</emphasis> is spliced into its female form and influences the expression of <emphasis effect="italics">dsx</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">fru</emphasis> to result in female sexual characteristics. In the absence of <emphasis effect="italics">slx</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">tra</emphasis> is spliced into its male form and male sexual characteristics result.</para>

<caption>In <emphasis effect="italics">Drosophila melanogaster</emphasis>, the sex is determined by a series of splicing events in sex determination genes on a cell-by-cell basis without any involvement of sex hormones (which circulate throughout the entire body). The primary sex-determination gene is <emphasis effect="italics">Sex lethal</emphasis> (<emphasis effect="italics">Sxl</emphasis>), which is transcribed only when the X/A ratio (the X chromosome-to-autosome ratio) equals or exceeds 1. As females have two X chromosomes and males have one, <emphasis effect="italics">Sxl</emphasis> is transcribed only in females (see the figure, left part). Sxl is a splicing repressor and binds to its target, the primary RNA of the <emphasis effect="italics">transformer</emphasis> (<emphasis effect="italics">tra</emphasis>) gene, which undergoes differential splicing depending on the presence (female) or absence (male) of Sxl, yielding a protein-coding <emphasis effect="italics">tra</emphasis> mRNA only in females. The Tra protein binds to the primary RNAs of <emphasis effect="italics">doublesex</emphasis> (<emphasis effect="italics">dsx</emphasis>) and <emphasis effect="italics">fruitless</emphasis> (<emphasis effect="italics">fru</emphasis>). In females, Tra promotes splicing to occur near its binding site, whereas in males it uses an alternative, default splice site. The <emphasis effect="italics">dsx</emphasis> primary RNA thus produces female-specific mRNA and male-specific mRNA, both of which encode functional Dsx proteins, DsxF and DsxM, respectively. The presence (female) and absence (male) of Tra similarly results in female-type <emphasis effect="italics">fru</emphasis> mRNA and male-type <emphasis effect="italics">fru</emphasis> mRNA, but here, only the male-type <emphasis effect="italics">fru</emphasis> mRNA encodes a functional protein.</caption></figure><note id="fs-id2022629" class="interactive ost-assessed-feature ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch16-s04-lo01 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch16-s04-aplo-3-18 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch16-s04-aplo-3-19 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch16-s04-aplo-3-21"><label>Link to Learning</label>

<title>The Promoter and the Transcription Machinery</title>
<para id="fs-id1645226">Genes are organized to make the control of gene expression easier. The promoter region is immediately upstream of the coding sequence. This region can be short (only a few nucleotides in length) or quite long (hundreds of nucleotides long). The longer the promoter, the more available space for proteins to bind. This also adds more control to the transcription process. The length of the promoter is gene-specific and can differ dramatically between genes. Consequently, the level of control of gene expression can also differ quite dramatically between genes. The purpose of the promoter is to bind transcription factors that control the initiation of transcription.</para>
    <para id="fs-id2904783">Within the promoter region, just upstream of the transcriptional start site, resides the TATA box. This box is simply a repeat of thymine and adenine dinucleotides (literally, TATA repeats). RNA polymerase binds to the transcription initiation complex, allowing transcription to occur. To initiate transcription, a transcription factor (TFIID) is the first to bind to the TATA box. Binding of TFIID recruits other transcription factors, including TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH to the TATA box. Once this complex is assembled, RNA polymerase can bind to its upstream sequence. When bound along with the transcription factors, RNA polymerase is phosphorylated. This releases part of the protein from the DNA to activate the transcription initiation complex and places RNA polymerase in the correct orientation to begin transcription; DNA-bending protein brings the enhancer, which can be quite a distance from the gene, in contact with transcription factors and mediator proteins (<link target-id="fig-ch16_04_01"/>).</para>
<figure id="fig-ch16_04_01" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch16-s04-lo01 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch16-s04-aplo-3-18 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch16-s04-aplo-3-19 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch16-s04-aplo-3-20 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch16-s04-aplo-3-21">
<media id="fs-id1778252" alt="Eukaryotic gene expression is controlled by a promoter immediately adjacent to the gene, and an enhancer far upstream. The DNA folds over itself, bringing the enhancer next to the promoter. Transcription factors and mediator proteins are sandwiched between the promoter and the enhancer. Short DNA sequences within the enhancer called distal control elements bind activators, which in turn bind transcription factors and mediator proteins bound to the promoter. RNA polymerase binds the complex, allowing transcription to begin. Different genes have enhancers with different distal control elements, allowing differential regulation of transcription.">

<caption>An enhancer is a DNA sequence that promotes transcription. Each enhancer is made up of short DNA sequences called distal control elements. Activators bound to the distal control elements interact with mediator proteins and transcription factors. Two different genes may have the same promoter but different distal control elements, enabling differential gene expression.</caption></figure><para id="fs-id1911410">In addition to the general transcription factors, other transcription factors can bind to the promoter to regulate gene transcription. These transcription factors bind to the promoters of a specific set of genes. They are not general transcription factors that bind to every promoter complex, but are recruited to a specific sequence on the promoter of a specific gene. There are hundreds of transcription factors in a cell that each bind specifically to a particular DNA sequence motif. When transcription factors bind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene, it is referred to as a <term id="term-00001"><emphasis effect="italics">cis</emphasis>-acting element</term>, because it is on the same chromosome just next to the gene. The region that a particular transcription factor binds to is called the <term id="term-00002">transcription factor binding site</term>. Transcription factors respond to environmental stimuli that cause the proteins to find their binding sites and initiate transcription of the gene that is needed.</para>

<title>Enhancers and Transcription</title>
<para id="fs-id2700899">In some eukaryotic genes, there are regions that help increase or enhance transcription. These regions, called <term id="term-00003">enhancers</term>, are not necessarily close to the genes they enhance. They can be located upstream of a gene, within the coding region of the gene, downstream of a gene, or may be thousands of nucleotides away.</para>
    <para id="fs-id2373880">Enhancer regions are binding sequences, or sites, for transcription factors. When a DNA-bending protein binds, the shape of the DNA changes (<link target-id="fig-ch16_04_01"/>). This shape change allows for the interaction of the activators bound to the enhancers with the transcription factors bound to the promoter region and the RNA polymerase. Whereas DNA is generally depicted as a straight line in two dimensions, it is actually a three-dimensional object. Therefore, a nucleotide sequence thousands of nucleotides away can fold over and interact with a specific promoter.</para>

<para id="fs-id1797856">Like prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells also have mechanisms to prevent transcription. Transcriptional repressors can bind to promoter or enhancer regions and block transcription. Like the transcriptional activators, repressors respond to external stimuli to prevent the binding of activating transcription factors.</para>
