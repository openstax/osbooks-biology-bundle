<para id="fs-id1167067053746">Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) comprise the fourth group of biological macromolecules and contain phosphorus (P) in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Conserved through evolution in all organisms, nucleic acids store and transmit hereditary information. As will be explored in more detail in Chapters 14-17, DNA contains the instructions for the synthesis of proteins by dictating the sequences of amino acids in polypeptides through processes known as transcription and translation. Nucleic acids are made up of nucleotides; in turn, each nucleotide consists of a pentose sugar (deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA), a nitrogenous base (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine or uracil), and a phosphate group. DNA carries the genetic blueprint of the cell that is passed from parent to offspring via cell division. DNA has a double-helical structure with the two strands running in opposite directions (antiparallel), connected by hydrogen bonds and complementary to each other. In DNA, purines pair with pyrimidines: adenine pairs with thymine (A-T), and cytosine pairs with guanine (C-G). In RNA, uracil replaces thymine to pair with adenine (U-A). RNA also differs from DNA in that it is single-stranded and has many forms, such as messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA) that all participate in the synthesis of proteins. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the use of mRNA. The flow of genetic information is usually DNA → RNA → protein, also known as the Central Dogma of Life.</para>

Ask the students to imagine a rope ladder with the top of the right side labeled 3 and the other end of that side labeled 5. The top of the left side is labeled 5 and the other end 3, so the numbers are going in opposite directions on opposite sides of the ladder, giving the sides of the structure an antiparallel orientation. Now imagine grabbing the ladder from the top and twisting. That is a double helix. It is double because there are two sides to it. You might try to draw a ladder, with its labels; then, ask the students to imagine it twisting. Another possibility is to have students use pipe cleaners to build the double helix.</para>

<caption>A nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and one or more phosphate groups. Carbon residues in the pentose are numbered 1′ through 5′ (the prime distinguishes these residues from those in the base, which are numbered without using a prime notation). The base is attached to the 1′ position of the ribose, and the phosphate is attached to the 5′ position. When a polynucleotide is formed, the 5′ phosphate of the incoming nucleotide attaches to the 3′ hydroxyl group at the end of the growing chain. Two types of pentose are found in nucleotides, deoxyribose (found in DNA) and ribose (found in RNA). Deoxyribose is similar in structure to ribose, but it has an H instead of an OH at the 2′ position. Bases can be divided into two categories: purines and pyrimidines. Purines have a double ring structure, and pyrimidines have a single ring.</caption></figure><para id="fs-id1582478">The nitrogenous bases, important components of nucleotides, are organic molecules and are so named because they contain carbon and nitrogen. They are bases because they contain an amino group that has the potential of binding an extra hydrogen, thus decreasing the hydrogen ion concentration in its environment, making it more basic.

The nitrogenous bases are stacked in the interior, like the steps of a staircase, in pairs; the pairs are bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. Every base pair in the double helix is separated from the next base pair by 0.34 nm. The two strands of the helix run in opposite directions, meaning that the 5′ carbon end of one strand will face the 3′ carbon end of its matching strand. (This is referred to as antiparallel orientation and is important to DNA replication and in many nucleic acid interactions.)</para><figure id="fs-id1167067174426" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch03-s05-lo02 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch03-s05-aplo-4-1 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch03-s05-aplo-4-2">

RNA is usually single-stranded and is made of ribonucleotides that are linked by phosphodiester bonds. A ribonucleotide in the RNA chain contains ribose (the pentose sugar), one of the four nitrogenous bases (A, U, G, and C), and the phosphate group.</para>
<para id="fs-id2626112">There are four major types of RNA: messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and microRNA (miRNA). The first, mRNA, carries the message from DNA, which controls all of the cellular activities in a cell. If a cell requires a certain protein to be synthesized, the gene for this product is turned “on” and the messenger RNA is synthesized in the nucleus. The RNA base sequence is complementary to the coding sequence of the DNA from which it has been copied. However, in RNA, the base T is absent and U is present instead. If the DNA strand has a sequence AATTGCGC, the sequence of the complementary RNA is UUAACGCG.

The rRNA ensures the proper alignment of the mRNA and the ribosomes; the rRNA of the ribosome also has an enzymatic activity (peptidyl transferase) and catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds between two aligned amino acids. <term id="term-00011">Transfer RNA (tRNA)</term> is one of the smallest of the four types of RNA, usually 70–90 nucleotides long. It carries the correct amino acid to the site of protein synthesis.

<para id="fs-id1569149">Even though the RNA is single stranded, most RNA types show extensive intramolecular base pairing between complementary sequences, creating a predictable three-dimensional structure essential for their function.</para>
<para id="fs-id1438288">As you have learned, information flow in an organism takes place from DNA to RNA to protein. DNA dictates the structure of mRNA in a process known as <term id="term-00012">transcription</term>, and RNA dictates the structure of protein in a process known as <term id="term-00013">translation</term>. This is known as the Central Dogma of Life, which holds true for all organisms; however, exceptions to the rule occur in connection with viral infections.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-id2072549">Nucleic acids are molecules made up of nucleotides that direct cellular activities such as cell division and protein synthesis. Each nucleotide is made up of a pentose sugar, a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group. There are two types of nucleic acids: DNA and RNA. DNA carries the genetic blueprint of the cell and is passed on from parents to offspring (in the form of chromosomes). It has a double-helical structure with the two strands running in opposite directions, connected by hydrogen bonds, and complementary to each other. RNA is single-stranded and is made of a pentose sugar (ribose), a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group. RNA is involved in protein synthesis and its regulation. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is copied from the DNA, is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and contains information for the construction of proteins. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a part of the ribosomes at the site of protein synthesis, whereas transfer RNA (tRNA) carries the amino acid to the site of protein synthesis. MicroRNA regulates the use of mRNA for protein synthesis.</para></section>

<para id="fs-id1166171750282">The nucleobase part of deoxyribonucleic acid encodes information in each component in the sequence making up the polymer. There are five nucleobases that are commonly represented by only a single letter: A (adenine), C (cytosine), G (guanine), T (thymine), and U (uracil). These molecules form a bond with the 1-carbon of deoxyribose. In this problem, we need to look at the molecules in slightly more detail so that you can development the ability to explain why DNA, and sometimes RNA, is the primary source of heritable information.</para>
<para id="fs-id1166171887376">Edwin Chargaff and his team isolated nucleobases from salmon sperm and determined the fraction of each (Chargaff et al., <emphasis effect="italics">Journal of Biological Chemistry</emphasis>, 192, 1951). Experiments in which the fraction of all four nucleobases was determined are shown. Also shown are averages as two standard deviations and the sum of total fractions for each experiment. Precision is calculated with each average.</para>
<para id="fs-id1166173565023">Shown below are the chemical structures of these four nucleobases. In these structures, the nitrogen that attaches to the 2-deoxyribose, 5-phosphate polymer is indicated as N*. The partial charges of particular atoms are indicated with δ<sup>+</sup> and δ<sup>-</sup>.</para>

<para id="fs-id1166168459587">Demonstrating an understanding of the replication of DNA requires the ability to explain how the two polymer strands of the double helix interact and grow. To retrieve information from DNA, the strands must be separated. The proteins that perform that task interact with the polymer without forming new chemical bonds. In their paper (Watson and Crick, <emphasis effect="italics">Nature</emphasis>, 3, 1953) announcing the structure of the polymer that we consider in this problem, Watson and Crick stated, It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.</para>
<para id="fs-id1166173368866">Eschenmoser and Lowenthal (<emphasis effect="italics">Chemical Society Reviews</emphasis>, 21, 1992) asked why the 5-carbon sugar ribose is used in DNA when the 6-carbon sugar glucose is so common in biological systems. To answer the question, they synthesized polymeric chains with this alternative form of sugar. They discovered that the strength of the interaction between pairs of nucleobases increased in the new material. Paired strands of hexose-based polymers were more stable.</para>
<para id="fs-id1166168141929">The AP Biology Curriculum Framework (College Board, 2012) states, The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple and elegant solution for the transmission of heritable information to the next generation; by using each strand as a template, existing information can be preserved and duplicated with high fidelity within the replication process. However, the process of replication is imperfect.</para>
<para id="fs-id1166173611984">B. <emphasis>Explain</emphasis> why the weaker interaction observed by Eschenmoser and Lowenthal, and the acknowledgement in the Framework that replication is imperfect, support the claim implied by Watson and Crick that DNA is the source of heritable information.</para>
