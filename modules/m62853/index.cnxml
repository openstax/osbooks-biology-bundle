<para id="fs-id1167063687514">Did you eat cereal for breakfast or tomatoes in your dinner salad? Do you know someone who has received gene therapy to treat a disease such as cancer? Should your school, health insurance provider, or employer have access to your genetic profile? Understanding how DNA works has allowed scientists to recombine DNA molecules, clone organisms, and produce mice that glow in the dark. We likely have eaten genetically modified foods and are familiar with how DNA analysis is used to solve crimes. Manipulation of DNA by humans has resulted in bacteria that can protect plants from insect pests and restore ecosystems. Biotechnologies also have been used to produce insulin, hormones, antibiotics, and medicine that dissolve blood clots. Comparative genomics yields new insights into relationships among species, and DNA sequences reveal our personal genetic make-up. However, manipulation of DNA comes with social and ethical responsibilities, raising questions about its appropriate uses.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167063961397" class="ost-reading-discard">Nucleic acids can be isolated from cells for analysis by lysing cell membranes and enzymatically destroying all other macromolecules. Fragmented or whole chromosomes can be separated on the basis of size (base pair length) by gel electrophoresis. Short sequences of DNA or RNA can be amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Recombinant DNA technology can combine DNA from different sources using bacterial plasmids or viruses as vectors to carry foreign genes into host cells, resulting in genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Transgenic bacteria, agricultural plants such as corn and rice, and farm animals produce protein products such as hormones and vaccines that benefit humans. (It is important to remind ourselves that recombinant technology is possible because the genetic code is universal, and the processes of transcription and translation are fundamentally the same in all organisms.) Cloning produces genetically identical copies of DNA, cells, or even entire organisms (reproductive cloning). Genetic testing identifies disease-causing genes, and gene therapy can be used to treat or cure an inheritable disease. However, questions emerge from these technologies including the safety of GMOs and privacy issues.</para>

<para id="fs-id2989163"><term id="term-00001">Biotechnology</term> is the use of biological agents for technological advancement. Biotechnology was used for breeding livestock and crops long before the scientific basis of these techniques was understood. Since the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953, the field of biotechnology has grown rapidly through both academic research and private companies. The primary applications of this technology are in medicine (production of vaccines and antibiotics) and agriculture (genetic modification of crops, such as to increase yields). Biotechnology also has many industrial applications, such as fermentation, the treatment of oil spills, and the production of biofuels.</para>

<title>Basic Techniques to Manipulate Genetic Material (DNA and RNA)</title>
<para id="fs-id2200536">To understand the basic techniques used to work with nucleic acids, remember that nucleic acids are macromolecules made of nucleotides (a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base) linked by phosphodiester bonds. The phosphate groups on these molecules each have a net negative charge. An entire set of DNA molecules in the nucleus is called the genome. DNA has two complementary strands linked by hydrogen bonds between the paired bases. The two strands can be separated by exposure to high temperatures (DNA denaturation) and can be reannealed by cooling. The DNA can be replicated by the DNA polymerase enzyme. Unlike DNA, which is located in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, RNA molecules leave the nucleus. The most common type of RNA that is analyzed is the messenger RNA (mRNA) because it represents the protein-coding genes that are actively expressed. However, RNA molecules present some other challenges to analysis, as they are often less stable than DNA.</para>

<title>DNA and RNA Extraction</title>
<para id="fs-id2415311">To study or manipulate nucleic acids, the DNA or RNA must first be isolated or extracted from the cells. Various techniques are used to extract different types of DNA (<link target-id="fig-ch17_01_02"/>). Most nucleic acid extraction techniques involve steps to break open the cell and use enzymatic reactions to destroy all macromolecules that are not desired (such as degradation of unwanted molecules and separation from the DNA sample). Cells are broken using a <term id="term-00002">lysis buffer</term> (a solution which is mostly a detergent); lysis means “to split.” These enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes. Macromolecules are inactivated using enzymes such as <term id="term-00003">proteases</term> that break down proteins, and <term id="term-00004">ribonucleases</term> (RNAses) that break down RNA. The DNA is then precipitated using alcohol. Human genomic DNA is usually visible as a gelatinous, white mass. The DNA samples can be stored frozen at –80°C for several years.</para>

In the first step, cells in a test tube are lysed using a detergent that disrupts the plasma membrane. In the second step, cell contents are treated with protease to destroy protein, and RNAase to destroy RNA. The resulting slurry is centrifuged to pellet the cell debris. The supernatant, or liquid, containing the DNA is then transferred to a clean test tube. The DNA is precipitated with ethanol.

<title>Gel Electrophoresis</title>
<para id="fs-id2682756">Because nucleic acids are negatively charged ions at neutral or basic pH in an aqueous environment, they can be mobilized by an electric field. <term id="term-00005">Gel electrophoresis</term> is a technique used to separate molecules on the basis of size, using this charge. The nucleic acids can be separated as whole chromosomes or fragments. The nucleic acids are loaded into a slot near the negative electrode of a semisolid, porous gel matrix and pulled toward the positive electrode at the opposite end of the gel. Smaller molecules move through the pores in the gel faster than larger molecules; this difference in the rate of migration separates the fragments on the basis of size. There are molecular weight standard samples that can be run alongside the molecules to provide a size comparison. Nucleic acids in a gel matrix can be observed using various fluorescent or colored dyes. Distinct nucleic acid fragments appear as bands at specific distances from the top of the gel (the negative electrode end) on the basis of their size (<link target-id="fig-ch17_01_03"/>). A mixture of genomic DNA fragments of varying sizes appear as a long smear, whereas uncut genomic DNA is usually too large to run through the gel and forms a single large band at the top of the gel.</para>

The DNA appears as thin, white bands on a black background. Lanes one and nine contain many bands from a DNA standard. These bands are closely spaced toward the top, and spaced farther apart further down the gel. Lanes two through eight contain one or two bands each. Some of these bands are identical in size and run the same distance into the gel. Others run a slightly different distance, indicating a small difference in size.">

<title>Amplification of Nucleic Acid Fragments by Polymerase Chain Reaction</title>
<para id="fs-id2075973">Although genomic DNA is visible to the naked eye when it is extracted in bulk, DNA analysis often requires focusing on one or more specific regions of the genome. <emphasis effect="bold">Polymerase chain reaction</emphasis> (<emphasis effect="bold">PCR</emphasis>) is a technique used to amplify specific regions of DNA for further analysis (<link target-id="fig-ch17_01_04"/>).

More practical applications include the detection of genetic diseases.</para>

PCR consists of three steps—denaturation, annealing, and DNA synthesis—that occur at high, low, and intermediate temperatures. In step 1, the denaturation step, the sample is heated to a high temperature so the DNA strands separate. In step 2, annealing, the sample is cooled so two primers can anneal to the two strands of DNA. The primers are spaced such that the sequence of interest between them will be amplified. In step 3, DNA synthesis, the sample is warmed to the optimal temperature for Taq polymerase, which synthesizes the complementary strand from the primer to the 3' end of the molecule. This cycle is repeated again and again. Each time, the newly synthesized strands serve as templates so that the amount of DNA doubles with each cycle. As the cycles continue, more and more strands are the size of the distance between the two primers; in the end, the vast majority of strands are this size.">

<title>Molecular Cloning</title>
<para id="fs-id1420611">In general, the word “cloning” means the creation of a perfect replica; however, in biology, the re-creation of a whole organism is referred to as “reproductive cloning.” Long before attempts were made to clone an entire organism, researchers learned how to reproduce desired regions or fragments of the genome, a process that is referred to as molecular cloning.</para>
<para id="fs-id2990504">Cloning small fragments of the genome allows for the manipulation and study of specific genes (and their protein products), or noncoding regions in isolation. A plasmid (also called a vector) is a small circular DNA molecule that replicates independently of the chromosomal DNA. In cloning, the plasmid molecules can be used to provide a "folder" in which to insert a desired DNA fragment. Plasmids are usually introduced into a bacterial host for proliferation. In the bacterial context, the fragment of DNA from the human genome (or the genome of another organism that is being studied) is referred to as <term id="term-00011">foreign DNA</term>, or a transgene, to differentiate it from the DNA of the bacterium, which is called the <term id="term-00012">host DNA</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id960434">Plasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations (such as <emphasis effect="italics">Escherichia coli</emphasis>) and have genes that can contribute favorable traits to the organism, such as <term id="term-00013">antibiotic resistance</term> (the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics). Plasmids have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large-scale production of important reagents, such as insulin and human growth hormone. An important feature of plasmid vectors is the ease with which a foreign DNA fragment can be introduced via the <term id="term-00014">multiple cloning site (MCS)</term>. The MCS is a short DNA sequence containing multiple sites that can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases. <term id="term-00015">Restriction endonucleases</term> recognize specific DNA sequences and cut them in a predictable manner; they are naturally produced by bacteria as a defense mechanism against foreign DNA. Many restriction endonucleases make staggered cuts in the two strands of DNA, such that the cut ends have a 2- or 4-base single-stranded overhang. Because these overhangs are capable of annealing with complementary overhangs, these are called “sticky ends.” Addition of an enzyme called DNA ligase permanently joins the DNA fragments via phosphodiester bonds. In this way, any DNA fragment generated by restriction endonuclease cleavage can be spliced between the two ends of a plasmid DNA that has been cut with the same restriction endonuclease (<link target-id="fig-ch17_01_06"/>).</para>
<section id="fs-id1772951" class="ost-get-exercise">
<title>Recombinant DNA Molecules</title>
<para id="fs-id2042376">Plasmids with foreign DNA inserted into them are called <term id="term-00016">recombinant DNA</term> molecules because they are created artificially and do not occur in nature. They are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of different parts of the molecules can be traced back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis. Proteins that are expressed from recombinant DNA molecules are called <term id="term-00017">recombinant proteins</term>. Not all recombinant plasmids are capable of expressing genes. The recombinant DNA may need to be moved into a different vector (or host) that is better designed for gene expression. Plasmids may also be engineered to express proteins only when stimulated by certain environmental factors, so that scientists can control the expression of the recombinant proteins.</para>

<figure id="fig-ch17_01_06"><media id="fs-id2919087" alt="Figure illustrates the steps in molecular cloning into a plasmid called a cloning vector. The vector has a lacZ gene, which is necessary for metabolizing lactose, and a gene for ampicillin resistance. Within the lacZ gene are restriction sites, sequences of DNA cut by a particular restriction enzyme. The DNA to be cloned and the plasmid are both cut by the same restriction enzyme. The restriction enzyme staggers the cuts on the two strands of DNA, such that each strand has an overhanging single-stranded bit of DNA. On one strand, the sequence of the overhang is GATC, and on the other, the sequence is CTAG. These two sequences are complementary, and allow the fragment of foreign DNA to anneal with the plasmid. An enzyme called ligase joins the two pieces together. The ligated plasmid is then transformed into a bacterial strain that lacks the lacZ gene and is sensitive to the antibiotic ampicillin. The bacteria are plated on media containing ampicillin, so that only bacteria that have taking up the plasmid (which has an ampicillin resistance gene) will grow. The media also contains X-gal, a chemical that is metabolized in the same way as lactose. Plasmids lacking the insert are able to metabolize X-gal, releasing a dye from X-gal that turns the colony blue. Plasmids with the insert have a disrupted lacZ gene and produce white colonies. Thus, colonies containing the cloned DNA can be selected on the basis of color.">

<para id="fs-id1167066841777">Cloning can be used to quickly replicate crop plants that have advantageous genes, such as greater disease resistance or greater fruit production. However, cloning also produces crop plants that have little genetic variation. In a group, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using clones as human food sources in an era where the Earth is undergoing a period of climate change. How well will cloned populations of crop plants be able to adapt to climate change, compared to non-clone crop plants? Then, defend your group’s position against those of other groups in a classroom debate.</para>

<section id="fs-id1397721" class="ost-get-exercise"><title>Reproductive Cloning</title><para id="fs-id2097772"><term id="term-00019">Reproductive cloning</term> is a method used to make a clone or an identical copy of an entire multicellular organism. Most multicellular organisms undergo reproduction by sexual means, which involves genetic hybridization of two individuals (parents), making it impossible for generation of an identical copy or a clone of either parent. Recent advances in biotechnology have made it possible to artificially induce asexual reproduction of mammals in the laboratory.</para>
<para id="fs-id2100688">Parthenogenesis, or “virgin birth,” occurs when an embryo grows and develops without the fertilization of the egg occurring; this is a form of asexual reproduction. An example of parthenogenesis occurs in species in which the female lays an egg and if the egg is fertilized, it is a diploid egg and the individual develops into a female; if the egg is not fertilized, it remains a haploid egg and develops into a male. The unfertilized egg is called a parthenogenic, or virgin, egg. Some insects and reptiles lay parthenogenic eggs that can develop into adults.</para>
<para id="fs-id1235778">Sexual reproduction requires two cells; when the haploid egg and sperm cells fuse, a diploid zygote results. The zygote nucleus contains the genetic information to produce a new individual. However, early embryonic development requires the cytoplasmic material contained in the egg cell. This idea forms the basis for reproductive cloning. Therefore, if the haploid nucleus of an egg cell is replaced with a diploid nucleus from the cell of any individual of the same species (called a donor), it will become a zygote that is genetically identical to the donor. Somatic cell nuclear transfer is the technique of transferring a diploid nucleus into an enucleated egg. It can be used for either therapeutic cloning or reproductive cloning.</para>
<para id="fs-id843472">The first cloned animal was Dolly, a sheep who was born in 1996. The success rate of reproductive cloning at the time was very low. Dolly lived for seven years and died of respiratory complications (<link target-id="fig-ch17_01_07"/>). There is speculation that because the cell DNA belongs to an older individual, the age of the DNA may affect the life expectancy of a cloned individual. Since Dolly, several animals such as horses, bulls, and goats have been successfully cloned, although these individuals often exhibit facial, limb, and cardiac abnormalities. There have been attempts at producing cloned human embryos as sources of embryonic stem cells, sometimes referred to as cloning for therapeutic purposes. Therapeutic cloning produces stem cells to attempt to remedy detrimental diseases or defects (unlike reproductive cloning, which aims to reproduce an organism). Still, therapeutic cloning efforts have met with resistance because of bioethical considerations.</para>

<title>Genetic Engineering</title>
<para id="fs-id1277417"><term id="term-00020">Genetic engineering</term> is the alteration of an organism’s genotype using recombinant DNA technology to modify an organism’s DNA to achieve desirable traits. The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering. The organism that receives the recombinant DNA is called a <term id="term-00021">genetically modified organism</term> (GMO). If the foreign DNA that is introduced comes from a different species, the host organism is called <term id="term-00022">transgenic</term>. Bacteria, plants, and animals have been genetically modified since the early 1970s for academic, medical, agricultural, and industrial purposes. In the US, GMOs such as herbicide-resistant soybeans and borer-resistant corn are part of many common processed foods.</para>

<title>Gene Targeting</title>
<para id="fs-id1082309">Although classical methods of studying the function of genes began with a given phenotype and determined the genetic basis of that phenotype, modern techniques allow researchers to start at the DNA sequence level and ask: "What does this gene or DNA element do?" This technique, called reverse genetics, has resulted in reversing the classic genetic methodology.  This method would be similar to damaging a body part to determine its function. An insect that loses a wing cannot fly, which means that the function of the wing is flight. The classical genetic method would compare insects that cannot fly with insects that can fly, and observe that the non-flying insects have lost wings. Similarly, mutating or deleting genes provides researchers with clues about gene function. The methods used to disable gene function are collectively called gene targeting. <term id="term-00023">Gene targeting</term> is the use of recombinant DNA vectors to alter the expression of a particular gene, either by introducing mutations in a gene, or by eliminating the expression of a certain gene by deleting a part or all of the gene sequence from the genome of an organism.</para>

<para id="fs-id2065754">The process of testing for suspected genetic defects before administering treatment is called <term id="term-00024">genetic diagnosis</term> by <term id="term-00025">genetic testing</term>. Depending on the inheritance patterns of a disease-causing gene, family members are advised to undergo genetic testing. For example, women diagnosed with breast cancer are usually advised to have a biopsy so that the medical team can determine the genetic basis of cancer development. Treatment plans are based on the findings of genetic tests that determine the type of cancer. If the cancer is caused by inherited gene mutations, other female relatives are also advised to undergo genetic testing and periodic screening for breast cancer. Genetic testing is also offered for fetuses (or embryos with in vitro fertilization) to determine the presence or absence of disease-causing genes in families with specific debilitating diseases.</para>
<para id="fs-id3059726"><term id="term-00026">Gene therapy</term> is a genetic engineering technique used to cure disease. In its simplest form, it involves the introduction of a good gene at a random location in the genome to aid the cure of a disease that is caused by a mutated gene. The good gene is usually introduced into diseased cells as part of a vector transmitted by a virus that can infect the host cell and deliver the foreign DNA (<link target-id="fig-ch17_01_08"/>).

<para id="fs-id1164967607243">The CRISPR system was discovered in cultures of yogurt in 2002.  Subsequently, researchers developed a technology based on the manipulation of this system.  The code for the prokaryotic CRISPR/cas system is highly conserved and is found in the human genome.  DNA sequences are known to encode proteins responsible for many heritable diseases.  CRISPR/cas is a technology that allows DNA to be cleaved at the boundaries of a nucleotide sequence, making the protein dysfunctional.  The break in the strand is then recognized and replaced with the code for the functional protein.  If the editing is done with zygote-forming cells, the change is inherited.  Not only the patient, but all progeny of the patient, are cured.  This technology is the first to easily make genomic modifications of a germ line.  In the words of a prominent molecular biologist, this technology, which was recognized as the <emphasis effect="italics">Breakthrough of 2015</emphasis> in the journal <emphasis effect="italics">Science</emphasis>, democratizes genetic engineering.  Just as PCR became a standard, widely used tool, any molecular biology lab is now able to apply this technology.</para><para id="fs-id1164965316542">B. <emphasis>Pose three questions</emphasis>whose pursuit would require an understanding of geneticsregarding the ethical and social issues that accompany the use of this medical technology.</para><para id="fs-id1164967453777">C. <emphasis>Explain</emphasis> the value of genetic variation within a population.  <emphasis>Predict</emphasis> a possible effect that this technology could have, if unregulated, on human genetic variation.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164967678153">Gel electrophoresis of polymers and polymer fragments is an important element in many investigations.  Samples of a solution are pipetted into the wells of a gel.  The gel is placed in a solution that maintains a constant pH, and an electric field is applied over the length of the gel.  Separated components are transferred to a substrate where they can be visualized and identified by comparison with samples of standards.  Application of this method to DNA is called a Southern blot, named for the inventor of the technology.  The methods application to RNA is called a northern blot, another demonstration that biologist have fun (there are also western, eastern, and far-eastern blots, but these techniques are <emphasis effect="italics">not</emphasis> named for their inventors).</para><para id="fs-id1164965279385">A.

The bottom C atom is connected on the bottom right side with H3c atom on the left side and a NH3 atom on the right side.

When becoming Histidine, the OH atom is turned into a C atom and connected by a double bond. This C atom connected to another C atom by a double bond is then connected by a single bond to the NH atom and then to a single CH atom, then to a double bond HN atom and finally that is connected back to the C atom by a single bond.">
