<title>Connection for AP<sup>®</sup> Courses</title><para id="fs-id1167066150917">After the information in the gene has been transcribed to mRNA, it is ready to be translated to polypeptide. The players in translation include the mRNA template, ribosomes, tRNA molecules, amino acids, and various enzymes. Ribosomes consist of small and large subunits of protein and rRNA which bind with mRNA; many ribosomes can move along the same mRNA at a time. Translation begins at the initiating AUG on mRNA, specifying methionine, the first amino acid in any polypeptide. Each amino acid is carried to the ribosome by attaching to a specific molecule of tRNA. A tRNA molecule often is depicted as a cloverleaf, with an anticodon on one end, and the amino acid attachment site at the other. Amino-acid charging enzymes ensure that the correct amino acid is attached to the correct tRNA. The anticodons on tRNA are complementary to the codons on mRNA; for example, the anticodon AAA on tRNA corresponds to TTT on mRNA. Sequential amino acids are linked by peptide bonds. The mRNA is translated, elongating the polypeptide, until a STOP or nonsense codon is reached. When this happens, a release factor dissociates the components and frees the new polypeptide. Folding of the protein occurs during and after translation. Once a polypeptide is synthesized, its role as a protein is established, such as determining a physical phenotype of an organism.</para>

[APLO 1.16][APLO 4.22][APLO 3.6]</para><para id="fs-id2195690">The synthesis of proteins consumes more of a cell’s energy than any other metabolic process. In turn, proteins account for more mass than any other component of living organisms (with the exception of water), and proteins perform virtually every function of a cell. The process of translation, or protein synthesis, involves the decoding of an mRNA message into a polypeptide product. Amino acids are covalently strung together by interlinking peptide bonds in lengths ranging from approximately 50 amino acid residues to more than 1,000. Each individual amino acid has an amino group (NH<sub>2</sub>) and a carboxyl (COOH) group. Polypeptides are formed when the amino group of one amino acid forms an amide (i.e., peptide) bond with the carboxyl group of another amino acid (<link target-id="fig-ch15_05_01"/>). This reaction is catalyzed by ribosomes and generates one water molecule.</para>

The composition of each component may vary across species; for instance, ribosomes may consist of different numbers of rRNAs and polypeptides depending on the organism.

<title>Ribosomes</title>
<para id="fs-id1769427">Even before an mRNA is translated, a cell must invest energy to build each of its ribosomes. In <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis>, there are  between 10,000 and 70,000  ribosomes present in each cell at any given time. A ribosome is a complex macromolecule composed of structural and catalytic rRNAs, and many distinct polypeptides. In eukaryotes, the nucleolus is completely specialized for the synthesis and assembly of rRNAs.</para><para id="fs-id2000981">Ribosomes exist in the cytoplasm in prokaryotes and in the cytoplasm and rough endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes. Mitochondria and chloroplasts also have their own ribosomes in the matrix and stroma, which look more similar to prokaryotic ribosomes (and have similar drug sensitivities) than the ribosomes just outside their outer membranes in the cytoplasm.  Ribosomes dissociate into large and small subunits when they are not synthesizing proteins and reassociate during the initiation of translation. In <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis>, the small subunit is described as 30S, and the large subunit is 50S, for a total of 70S (recall that Svedberg units are not additive). Mammalian ribosomes have a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit, for a total of 80S. The small subunit is responsible for binding the mRNA template, whereas the large subunit sequentially binds tRNAs. Each mRNA molecule is simultaneously translated by many ribosomes, all synthesizing protein in the same direction: reading the mRNA from 5' to 3' and synthesizing the polypeptide from the N terminus to the C terminus. The complete mRNA/poly-ribosome structure is called a <term id="term-00001">polysome</term>.</para>

<title>tRNAs</title>
<para id="fs-id1613052">The tRNAs are structural RNA molecules that were transcribed from genes by RNA polymerase III. Depending on the species, 40 to 60 types of tRNAs exist in the cytoplasm. Serving as adaptors, specific tRNAs bind to sequences on the mRNA template and add the corresponding amino acid to the polypeptide chain. Therefore, tRNAs are the molecules that actually “translate” the language of RNA into the language of proteins.</para>
<para id="fs-id2853827">Of the 64 possible mRNA codons—or triplet combinations of A, U, G, and C—three specify the termination of protein synthesis and 61 specify the addition of amino acids to the polypeptide chain. Of these 61, one codon (AUG) also encodes the initiation of translation. Each tRNA anticodon can base pair with one of the mRNA codons and add an amino acid or terminate translation, according to the genetic code. For instance, if the sequence CUA occurred on an mRNA template in the proper reading frame, it would bind a tRNA expressing the complementary sequence, GAU, which would be linked to the amino acid leucine.</para>
<para id="fs-id3063554">As the adaptor molecules of translation, it is surprising that tRNAs can fit so much specificity into such a small package. Consider that tRNAs need to interact with three factors:  1) they must be recognized by the correct aminoacyl synthetase (see below); 2) they must be recognized by ribosomes; and 3) they must bind to the correct sequence in mRNA.</para></section>

<title>Aminoacyl tRNA Synthetases</title>
<para id="fs-id1720501">The process of pre-tRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase III only creates the RNA portion of the adaptor molecule. The corresponding amino acid must be added later, once the tRNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm. Through the process of tRNA “charging,” each tRNA molecule is linked to its correct amino acid by a group of enzymes called <term id="term-00002">aminoacyl tRNA synthetases</term>. At least one type of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase exists for each of the 20 amino acids; the exact number of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases varies by species. These enzymes first bind and hydrolyze ATP to catalyze a high-energy bond between an amino acid and adenosine monophosphate (AMP); a pyrophosphate molecule is expelled in this reaction. The activated amino acid is then transferred to the tRNA, and AMP is released.</para>

<title>Initiation of Translation</title>
<para id="fs-id1240070">Protein synthesis begins with the formation of an initiation complex. In <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis>, this complex involves the small 30S ribosome, the mRNA template, three initiation factors (IFs; IF-1, IF-2, and IF-3), and a special <term id="term-00003">initiator tRNA</term>, called <m:math>

This interaction anchors the 30S ribosomal subunit at the correct location on the mRNA template. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is a purine nucleotide triphosphate, acts as an energy source during translation—both at the start of elongation and during the ribosome’s translocation.</para>
<para id="fs-id2334805">In eukaryotes, a similar initiation complex forms, comprising mRNA, the 40S small ribosomal subunit, IFs, and nucleoside triphosphates (GTP and ATP). The charged initiator tRNA, called Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>, does not bind fMet in eukaryotes, but is distinct from other Met-tRNAs in that it can bind IFs.</para>
<para id="fs-id3053365">Instead of depositing at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the eukaryotic initiation complex recognizes the 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5' end of the mRNA. A cap-binding protein (CBP) and several other IFs assist the movement of the ribosome to the 5' cap. Once at the cap, the initiation complex tracks along the mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction, searching for the AUG start codon. Many eukaryotic mRNAs are translated from the first AUG, but this is not always the case. According to <term id="term-00006">Kozak’s rules</term>, the nucleotides around the AUG indicate whether it is the correct start codon. Kozak’s rules state that the following consensus sequence must appear around the AUG of vertebrate genes: 5'-gccRccAUGG-3'. The R (for purine) indicates a site that can be either A or G, but cannot be C or U. Essentially, the closer the sequence is to this consensus, the higher the efficiency of translation.</para>
<para id="fs-id2682290">Once the appropriate AUG is identified, the other proteins and CBP dissociate, and the 60S subunit binds to the complex of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>, mRNA, and the 40S subunit. This step completes the initiation of translation in eukaryotes.</para>

<para id="fs-id2608514">Elongation proceeds with charged tRNAs entering the A site and then shifting to the P site followed by the E site with each single-codon “step” of the ribosome. Ribosomal steps are induced by conformational changes that advance the ribosome by three bases in the 3' direction. The energy for each step of the ribosome is donated by an elongation factor that hydrolyzes GTP. Peptide bonds form between the amino group of the amino acid attached to the A-site tRNA and the carboxyl group of the amino acid attached to the P-site tRNA. The formation of each peptide bond is catalyzed by <term id="term-00007">peptidyl transferase</term>, an RNA-based enzyme that is integrated into the 50S ribosomal subunit. The energy for each peptide bond formation is derived from GTP hydrolysis, which is catalyzed by a separate elongation factor. The amino acid bound to the P-site tRNA is also linked to the growing polypeptide chain. As the ribosome steps across the mRNA, the former P-site tRNA enters the E site, detaches from the amino acid, and is expelled (<link target-id="fig-ch15_05_02"/>).

</note><para id="fs-id2155698">Termination of translation occurs when a nonsense codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is encountered. Upon aligning with the A site, these nonsense codons are recognized by release factors in prokaryotes and eukaryotes that instruct peptidyl transferase to add a water molecule to the carboxyl end of the P-site amino acid. This reaction forces the P-site amino acid to detach from its tRNA, and the newly made protein is released. The small and large ribosomal subunits dissociate from the mRNA and from each other; they are recruited almost immediately into another translation initiation complex.

<title>Protein Folding, Modification, and Targeting</title>
<para id="fs-id2979153">During and after translation, individual amino acids may be chemically modified, signal sequences may be appended, and the new protein “folds” into a distinct three-dimensional structure as a result of intramolecular interactions. A <term id="term-00008">signal sequence</term> is a short tail of amino acids that directs a protein to a specific cellular compartment. These sequences at the amino end or the carboxyl end of the protein can be thought of as the protein’s “train ticket” to its ultimate destination. Other cellular factors recognize each signal sequence and help transport the protein from the cytoplasm to its correct compartment.

Even if a protein is properly specified by its corresponding mRNA, it could take on a completely dysfunctional shape if abnormal temperature or pH conditions prevent it from folding correctly.</para>

Even though there are six codons, the fifth codon corresponds to a stop, so the sixth codon would not be translated. Responses to the second part of the inquiry may vary, as it would be dependent upon which nucleotide was changed. For example, if the A in the first codon (AUG) was changed to C, no protein would result.</item>

<section id="fs-id2626207" class="summary ost-reading-discard"> <title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-id1957598">The players in translation include the mRNA template, ribosomes, tRNAs, and various enzymatic factors. The small ribosomal subunit forms on the mRNA template either at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (prokaryotes) or the 5' cap (eukaryotes). Translation begins at the initiating AUG on the mRNA, specifying methionine. The formation of peptide bonds occurs between sequential amino acids specified by the mRNA template according to the genetic code. Charged tRNAs enter the ribosomal A site, and their amino acid bonds with the amino acid at the P site. The entire mRNA is translated in three-nucleotide “steps” of the ribosome. When a nonsense codon is encountered, a release factor binds and dissociates the components and frees the new protein. Folding of the protein occurs during and after translation.</para>

<problem id="fs-id1164967454345">
<para id="fs-id1164967587711">Only a fraction of DNA encodes proteins.  The noncoding portion of a gene is referred to as the intron.  The intron fraction depends upon the gene.  Introns are rare in prokaryotic and mitochondrial DNA; in human nuclear DNA, this fraction is about 95%.  The intron is transcribed into mRNA, but this noncoding mRNA is edited out before translation of the coding portion, or exon, of a gene.  The edited exon segments are then spliced together by a spliceosome, a very large and complex collection of RNAs and proteins.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164967880362">Although introns do not encode proteins, they have functions.  In particular, they amplify expression of the exon, although the mechanism is unknown.  When introns are very long, which is common among mammalian genes with roles in development, they can significantly extend the time required to complete transcription.  Analysis of genes common to different plant and animal species shows many shared intronic positions and base sequences, although in some organisms, such as yeast, many introns have been deleted.  Because introns do not encode proteins, mutations can remain silent and accumulate.</para>
