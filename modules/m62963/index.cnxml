<para id="fs-id1167064928874">Much of the information in this section is an application of the material we explored in the Cell Communication chapter about cell communication and signaling pathways. Hormones are chemical signals (ligands) that mediate changes in target cells by binding to specific receptors. Even though hormones released by endocrine glands can travel long distances through the blood and come into contact with many different cell types, they only affect cells that possess the necessary receptors. Depending on the location of the receptor on the target cell and the chemical structure of the hormone, for example, whether or not it is lipid-soluble, hormones can mediate changes directly by binding to <emphasis>intracellular hormone receptors</emphasis> and modulating gene expression (transcription and translation), or indirectly by binding to cell surface receptors and simulating signaling pathways.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167063087931" class="ost-reading-discard">The hormone binds to its receptor like a key fits a lock. Because a lipid-derived hormone such as a steroid hormone can diffuse across the membrane of the target cell, they bind to intracellular receptors residing in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. The cell signaling pathways induced by steroid hormones regulate specific genes by acting as transcription regulators. In turn, this affects the amount of protein produced. Lipid-derived hormones that are not steroids, for example, vitamin D and thyroxin, bind to receptors located in the nucleus of the target cell.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065067029" class="ost-reading-discard">Because amino acid-derived hormones (with the exception of thyroxine) and polypeptide hormones are not lipid-soluble, they bind to <emphasis>plasma membrane hormone receptors</emphasis> located on the outer surface of the membrane. Unlike steroid hormones, they cannot act directly on DNA but activate a signaling pathway; this triggers intracellular activity and carries out the specific effects associated with the hormone. The hormone that initiated the signaling pathway is called a <emphasis>first messenger</emphasis>. In the case of the epinephrine signaling pathway, binding of the amino acid-derived hormone epinephrine to its receptor activates a G-protein which, in turn, activates cAMP, a second messenger, ultimately resulting in a cellular response such as the conversion of glycogen to glucose.</para><para id="fs-id1167066205375" class="ost-reading-discard">Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP<sup>®</sup> Biology Curriculum Framework.

<para id="fs-idp268044016">Hormones mediate changes in target cells by binding to specific <emphasis>hormone</emphasis> <emphasis>receptors</emphasis>. In this way, even though hormones circulate throughout the body and come into contact with many different cell types, they only affect cells that possess the necessary receptors. Receptors for a specific hormone may be found on many different cells or may be limited to a small number of specialized cells. For example, thyroid hormones act on many different tissue types, stimulating metabolic activity throughout the body. Cells can have many receptors for the same hormone but often also possess receptors for different types of hormones. The number of receptors that respond to a hormone determines the cell’s sensitivity to that hormone, and the resulting cellular response. Additionally, the number of receptors that respond to a hormone can change over time, resulting in increased or decreased cell sensitivity. In <emphasis>up-regulation</emphasis>, the number of receptors increases in response to prolonged low hormone levels, making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity. When the number of receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels, called <emphasis>down-regulation</emphasis>, cellular activity is reduced.</para>
<para id="fs-idp39453248">Receptor binding alters cellular activity and results in an increase or decrease in normal body processes. Depending on the location of the protein receptor on the target cell and the chemical structure of the hormone, hormones can mediate changes directly by binding to intracellular hormone receptors and modulating gene transcription, or indirectly by binding to cell surface receptors and stimulating signaling pathways.</para>

<title>Intracellular Hormone Receptors</title>
<para id="fs-idp39011552">Lipid-derived (soluble) hormones such as steroid hormones diffuse across the membranes of the endocrine cell. Once outside the cell, they bind to transport proteins that keep them soluble in the bloodstream. At the target cell, the hormones are released from the carrier protein and diffuse across the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane of cells. The steroid hormones pass through the plasma membrane of a target cell and adhere to intracellular receptors residing in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. The cell signaling pathways induced by the steroid hormones regulate specific genes on the cell's DNA. The hormones and receptor complex act as transcription regulators by increasing or decreasing the synthesis of mRNA molecules of specific genes. This, in turn, determines the amount of corresponding protein that is synthesized by altering gene expression. This protein can be used either to change the structure of the cell or to produce enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions. In this way, the steroid hormone regulates specific cell processes as illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch37_02_01"/>.</para>

<caption>An intracellular nuclear receptor (NR) is located in the cytoplasm bound to a heat shock protein (HSP).

<title>Plasma Membrane Hormone Receptors</title>
<para id="fs-idp78427184">Amino acid derived hormones and polypeptide hormones are not lipid-derived (lipid-soluble) and therefore cannot diffuse through the plasma membrane of cells. Lipid insoluble hormones bind to receptors on the outer surface of the plasma membrane, via plasma membrane hormone receptors. Unlike steroid hormones, lipid insoluble hormones do not directly affect the target cell because they cannot enter the cell and act directly on DNA. Binding of these hormones to a cell surface receptor results in activation of a signaling pathway; this triggers intracellular activity and carries out the specific effects associated with the hormone. In this way, nothing passes through the cell membrane; the hormone that binds at the surface remains at the surface of the cell while the intracellular product remains inside the cell. The hormone that initiates the signaling pathway is called a first messenger, which activates a second messenger in the cytoplasm, as illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch37_02_02"/>.</para>

<caption>The amino acid-derived hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine bind to beta-adrenergic receptors on the plasma membrane of cells. Hormone binding to receptor activates a G-protein, which in turn activates adenylyl cyclase, converting ATP to cAMP. cAMP is a second messenger that mediates a cell-specific response. An enzyme called phosphodiesterase breaks down cAMP, terminating the signal.</caption></figure><para id="fs-idp53679792">One very important second messenger is cyclic AMP (cAMP). When a hormone binds to its membrane receptor, a <emphasis>G-protein</emphasis> that is associated with the receptor is activated; G-proteins are proteins separate from receptors that are found in the cell membrane. When a hormone is not bound to the receptor, the G-protein is inactive and is bound to guanosine diphosphate, or GDP. When a hormone binds to the receptor, the G-protein is activated by binding guanosine triphosphate, or GTP, in place of GDP. After binding, GTP is hydrolysed by the G-protein into GDP and becomes inactive.</para><para id="fs-idp260294208">The activated G-protein in turn activates a membrane-bound enzyme called <emphasis>adenylyl cyclase</emphasis>. Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP. cAMP, in turn, activates a group of proteins called protein kinases, which transfer a phosphate group from ATP to a substrate molecule in a process called phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of a substrate molecule changes its structural orientation, thereby activating it. These activated molecules can then mediate changes in cellular processes.</para>
<para id="fs-idp54512752">The effect of a hormone is amplified as the signaling pathway progresses. The binding of a hormone at a single receptor causes the activation of many G-proteins, which activates adenylyl cyclase. Each molecule of adenylyl cyclase then triggers the formation of many molecules of cAMP. Further amplification occurs as protein kinases, once activated by cAMP, can catalyze many reactions. In this way, a small amount of hormone can trigger the formation of a large amount of cellular product. To stop hormone activity, cAMP is deactivated by the cytoplasmic enzyme <emphasis>phosphodiesterase</emphasis>, or PDE. PDE is always present in the cell and breaks down cAMP to control hormone activity, preventing overproduction of cellular products.</para><para id="fs-idp174337632">The specific response of a cell to a lipid insoluble hormone depends on the type of receptors that are present on the cell membrane and the substrate molecules present in the cell cytoplasm. Cellular responses to hormone binding of a receptor include altering membrane permeability and metabolic pathways, stimulating synthesis of proteins and enzymes, and activating hormone release.</para>

<para id="fs-id1166168474714">FSH and LH inhibit production of GnRH.  Exposure of ovarian follicles to high levels of FSH and LH causes the follicle to rupture, releasing an oocyte to the oviduct.   Birth control drugs suppress the LH surge by maintaining a constant blood concentration of progesterone (PG).  After 40 years of use, the mechanism of suppression is still unknown.  However, we do know that during pregnancy progesterone levels remain elevated and that cells in both the pituitary gland and GnRH expressing neurons (GEN) have progesterone nuclear receptors (PGR) that act as transcription factors to either i) inhibit production of GnRH possibly by blocking transcription of <emphasis effect="italics">GNRH1</emphasis>, the gene coding for GnRH, or ii) inhibit production of LH by blocking transcription in the GnRH neurons of the gene, <emphasis effect="italics">LH1</emphasis>, coding for LH.</para>

The chemical bis-phenol A (BPA) has been used for many years in the production of plastics and is now widespread. BPA mimics estrogen.  BPA is present in most humans at the concentration of 5 micrograms per kilogram of body weight. Whether or not that concentration is harmful is uncertain.</para>

This suggests a mechanism for the results from an earlier investigation in which female rats were fed low and high levels of estrogen (EE) and BPA during pregnancy.  Measurements were made of the levels of expression of an estrogen nuclear receptor in the hypothalamus of the pups just after birth (Cao et al., <emphasis effect="italics">Toxicological Sciences</emphasis>, 133, 2013).
