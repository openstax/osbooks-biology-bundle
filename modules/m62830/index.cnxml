<title>Connection for AP<sup>®</sup> Courses</title><para id="fs-id1167063775066">DNA polymerase is an efficient enzyme but it can make mistakes while adding nucleotides during replication. It edits the DNA by proofreading every newly added base. An incorrect base is removed and replaced by the correct base. If a base remains mismatched, special repair enzymes can often recognize the wrongly incorporated base, excise it from the DNA, and replace it with the correct base. Most mistakes are corrected, but if they are not they may result in a mutation, which is defined as a permanent change in a DNA sequence. A mutation can be passed to daughter cells through DNA replication and cell division. There are several types of DNA mutations, including substitution, deletion, insertion, and translocation. Mutations in repair genes may lead to serious consequences, such as cancer. Mutations can be induced by environmental factors, such as UV radiation, or they can occur spontaneously. (We will explore the effects of mutation in more detail in a later chapter. Remember that mutations are not always detrimental. They can be beneficial, too. Changes in DNA increase genetic variation—the foundation of evolution by natural selection.)</para>

<para id="fs-id1976493">DNA replication is a highly accurate process, but mistakes can occasionally occur, such as a DNA polymerase inserting a wrong base. Uncorrected mistakes may sometimes lead to serious consequences, such as cancer. Repair mechanisms correct the mistakes. In rare cases, mistakes are not corrected, leading to mutations; in other cases, repair enzymes are themselves mutated or defective.</para>
<para id="fs-id2348700">Most of the mistakes during DNA replication are promptly corrected by DNA polymerase by proofreading the base that has been just added (<link target-id="fig-ch14_06_01"/>). In <term id="term-00001">proofreading</term>, the DNA pol reads the newly added base before adding the next one, so a correction can be made. The polymerase checks whether the newly added base has paired correctly with the base in the template strand. If it is the right base, the next nucleotide is added. If an incorrect base has been added, the enzyme makes a cut at the phosphodiester bond and releases the wrong nucleotide. This is performed by the exonuclease action of DNA pol III. Once the incorrect nucleotide has been removed, a new one will be added again.</para>

<caption>Proofreading by DNA polymerase corrects errors during replication.</caption></figure>
<para id="fs-id2186525">Some errors are not corrected during replication, but are instead corrected after replication is completed; this type of repair is known as <term id="term-00002">mismatch repair</term> (<link target-id="fig-ch14_06_02"/>). The enzymes recognize the incorrectly added nucleotide and excise it; this is then replaced by the correct base. If this remains uncorrected, it may lead to more permanent damage. How do mismatch repair enzymes recognize which of the two bases is the incorrect one? In <emphasis effect="italics">E. coli</emphasis>, after replication, the nitrogenous base adenine acquires a methyl group; the parental DNA strand will have methyl groups, whereas the newly synthesized strand lacks them. Thus, DNA polymerase is able to remove the wrongly incorporated bases from the newly synthesized, non-methylated strand. In eukaryotes, the mechanism is not very well understood, but it is believed to involve recognition of unsealed nicks in the new strand, as well as a short-term continuing association of some of the replication proteins with the new daughter strand after replication has completed.</para>

The segment of DNA is removed and replaced with the correctly paired nucleotides by the action of DNA pol. Once the bases are filled in, the remaining gap is sealed with a phosphodiester linkage catalyzed by DNA ligase. This repair mechanism is often employed when UV exposure causes the formation of pyrimidine dimers.</para>

Affected individuals have skin that is highly sensitive to UV rays from the sun. When individuals are exposed to UV, pyrimidine dimers, especially those of thymine, are formed; people with xeroderma pigmentosa are not able to repair the damage. These are not repaired because of a defect in the nucleotide excision repair enzymes, whereas in normal individuals, the thymine dimers are excised and the defect is corrected. The thymine dimers distort the structure of the DNA double helix, and this may cause problems during DNA replication.</para><figure id="fig-ch14_06_04" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch14-s06-lo02 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch14-s06-aplo-3-24"><media id="fs-id2583496" alt="Photo shows a person with mottled skin lesions that result from xermoderma pigmentosa.">

The most common nucleotide mutations are substitutions, in which one base is replaced by another. These can be of two types, either transitions or transversions. <term id="term-00009">Transition substitution</term> refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind; for example, a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine. <term id="term-00010">Transversion substitution</term> refers to a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine, or vice versa; for example, cytosine, a pyrimidine, is replaced by adenine, a purine. Mutations can also be the result of the addition of a base, known as an insertion, or the removal of a base, also known as deletion. Sometimes a piece of DNA from one chromosome may get translocated to another chromosome or to another region of the same chromosome; this is also known as translocation. These mutation types are shown in <link target-id="fig-ch14_06_05"/>.</para>

If a chromosome translocation occurs in a germ cell it could affect the function of genes required for the formation of reproductive cells. If severe enough, the mutation could give rise to infertility. A translocation in a germ cell that does not affect genes required for sex cell formation would likely not affect fertility. Neither would a translocation that occurs in a somatic cell.</note>
