<para id="fs-id1167063774882">Because prokaryotes are metabolically diverse organisms, they can flourish in many different environments using a wide range of energy and carbon sources. Some are decomposers that are essential to the cycling of nutrients in ecosystems, for example, carbon and nitrogen cycles. (Later, we will explore in more depth the role of these cycles in ecosystems.) Many bacteria form symbiotic relationships with other organisms; for example, nitrogen-fixing bacteria live on the roots of legumes. Other bacteria are disease-causing pathogens or parasites.</para><para id="fs-id1167066800840" class="ost-reading-discard">Like all cells, prokaryotes require macronutrients (including carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur) and micronutrients, such as metallic elements from growth and enzyme function.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167061419981">Three mechanisms—rapid reproduction, genetic recombination, and mutation—give rise to the extensive genetic variation found in prokaryotic populations. This genetic diversity is reflected in the broadly ranging nutritional and metabolic adaptations of prokaryotes. As is true for all organisms, prokaryotes can be organized by their nutritional and metabolic needs, or, how they obtain the energy and carbon needed to make the organic molecules that are the building blocks of cells. The nutritional diversity of prokaryotes is greater than that of eukaryotes. While all of nutritional modes observed in eukaryotes is also observed in prokaryotes, there are some nutritional modes that are unique to prokaryotic populations. These modes include chemoautotrophy and photoheterotrophy.</para>

<title>Needs of Prokaryotes</title>
<para id="fs-idp58811600">The diverse environments and ecosystems on Earth have a wide range of conditions in terms of temperature, available nutrients, acidity, salinity, and energy sources. Prokaryotes are very well equipped to make their living out of a vast array of nutrients and conditions. To live, prokaryotes need a source of energy, a source of carbon, and some additional nutrients.</para>
<section id="fs-idp69108640" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch22-s03-lo01">
<title>Macronutrients</title>
<para id="fs-idm31669472">Cells are essentially a well-organized assemblage of macromolecules and water. Recall that macromolecules are produced by the polymerization of smaller units called monomers. For cells to build all of the molecules required to sustain life, they need certain substances, collectively called <emphasis>nutrients</emphasis>. When prokaryotes grow in nature, they obtain their nutrients from the environment. Nutrients that are required in large amounts are called macronutrients, whereas those required in smaller or trace amounts are called micronutrients. Just a handful of elements are considered macronutrients—carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. (A mnemonic for remembering these elements is the acronym <emphasis effect="italics">CHONPS</emphasis>.)</para>
<para id="fs-idp12908480">Why are these macronutrients needed in large amounts? They are the components of organic compounds in cells, including water. Carbon is the major element in all macromolecules: carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and many other compounds. Carbon accounts for about 50 percent of the composition of the cell. Nitrogen represents 12 percent of the total dry weight of a typical cell and is a component of proteins, nucleic acids, and other cell constituents. Most of the nitrogen available in nature is either atmospheric nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) or another inorganic form. Diatomic (N<sub>2</sub>) nitrogen, however, can be converted into an organic form only by certain organisms, called nitrogen-fixing organisms. Both hydrogen and oxygen are part of many organic compounds and of water. Phosphorus is required by all organisms for the synthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids. Sulfur is part of the structure of some amino acids such as cysteine and methionine, and is also present in several vitamins and coenzymes. Other important macronutrients are potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), and sodium (Na). Although these elements are required in smaller amounts, they are very important for the structure and function of the prokaryotic cell.</para>

<title>Micronutrients</title>
<para id="fs-idm32094128">In addition to these macronutrients, prokaryotes require various metallic elements in small amounts. These are referred to as micronutrients or trace elements.

In contrast, <term id="term-00002">heterotrophic</term> prokaryotes obtain carbon from organic compounds.

<title>Role of Prokaryotes in Ecosystems</title>
<para id="fs-idm47975664">Prokaryotes are ubiquitous: There is no niche or ecosystem in which they are not present. Prokaryotes play many roles in the environments they occupy. The roles they play in the carbon and nitrogen cycles are vital to life on Earth.</para>
<section id="fs-idm18679632" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch22-s03-lo02 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch22-s03-aplo-2-4 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch22-s03-aplo-2-5">
<title>Prokaryotes and the Carbon Cycle</title>
<para id="fs-idp132815728">Carbon is one of the most important macronutrients, and prokaryotes play an important role in the carbon cycle (<link target-id="fig-ch22_03_01"/>). Carbon is cycled through Earth’s major reservoirs: land, the atmosphere, aquatic environments, sediments and rocks, and biomass. The movement of carbon is via carbon dioxide, which is removed from the atmosphere by land plants and marine prokaryotes, and is returned to the atmosphere via the respiration of chemoorganotrophic organisms, including prokaryotes, fungi, and animals. Although the largest carbon reservoir in terrestrial ecosystems is in rocks and sediments, that carbon is not readily available.</para>
<para id="fs-idm48166784">A large amount of available carbon is found in land plants. Plants, which are producers, use carbon dioxide from the air to synthesize carbon compounds. Related to this, one very significant source of carbon compounds is humus, which is a mixture of organic materials from dead plants and prokaryotes that have resisted decomposition. Consumers such as animals use organic compounds generated by producers and release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Then, bacteria and fungi, collectively called <emphasis>decomposers</emphasis>, carry out the breakdown (decomposition) of plants and animals and their organic compounds. The most important contributor of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is microbial decomposition of dead material (dead animals, plants, and humus) that undergo respiration.</para>
<para id="fs-idp54591920">In aqueous environments and their anoxic sediments, there is another carbon cycle taking place. In this case, the cycle is based on one-carbon compounds. In anoxic sediments, prokaryotes, mostly archaea, produce methane (CH<sub>4</sub>). This methane moves into the zone above the sediment, which is richer in oxygen and supports bacteria called methane oxidizers that oxidize methane to carbon dioxide, which then returns to the atmosphere.</para>

<title>Prokaryotes and the Nitrogen Cycle</title>
<para id="fs-idp73980592">Nitrogen is a very important element for life because it is part of proteins and nucleic acids. It is a macronutrient, and in nature, it is recycled from organic compounds to ammonia, ammonium ions, nitrate, nitrite, and nitrogen gas by myriad processes, many of which are carried out only by prokaryotes. As illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch22_03_02"/>, prokaryotes are key to the nitrogen cycle. The largest pool of nitrogen available in the terrestrial ecosystem is gaseous nitrogen from the air, but this nitrogen is not usable by plants, which are primary producers. Gaseous nitrogen is transformed, or “fixed” into more readily available forms such as ammonia through the process of <emphasis>nitrogen fixation</emphasis>. Ammonia can be used by plants or converted to other forms.</para><para id="fs-idp50138704">Another source of ammonia is <emphasis>ammonification</emphasis>, the process by which ammonia is released during the decomposition of nitrogen-containing organic compounds. Ammonia released to the atmosphere, however, represents only 15 percent of the total nitrogen released; the rest is as N<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O. Ammonia is catabolized anaerobically by some prokaryotes, yielding N<sub>2</sub> as the final product. <emphasis>Nitrification</emphasis> is the conversion of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate. Nitrification in soils is carried out by bacteria belonging to the genera <emphasis effect="italics">Nitrosomas</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">Nitrobacter</emphasis>, and<emphasis effect="italics"> Nitrospira</emphasis>. The bacteria performs the reverse process, the reduction of nitrate from the soils to gaseous compounds such as N<sub>2</sub>O, NO, and N<sub>2</sub>, a process called <emphasis>denitrification</emphasis>.</para>

<para id="fs-idm27136640">Think about the conditions (temperature, light, pressure, and organic and inorganic materials) that you may find in a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. What type of prokaryotes, in terms of their metabolic needs (autotrophs, phototrophs, chemotrophs, etc.), would you expect to find there?</para>

<solution id="fs-idm27177376">
<label/>
<para id="fs-idm77072976">Responses will vary. In a deep-sea hydrothermal vent, there is no light, so prokaryotes would be chemotrophs instead of phototrophs. The source of carbon would be carbon dioxide dissolved in the ocean, so they would be autotrophs. There is not a lot of organic material in the ocean, so prokaryotes would probably use inorganic sources, thus they would be chemolitotrophs. The temperatures are very high in the hydrothermal vent, so the prokaryotes would be thermophilic.</para>

Some cyanobacteria cooperatively aggregate as filaments, and heterocysts may form at intervals along the filament between a pair of vegetative (actively growing) cells. Heterocysts are specialized cells that express certain genes when nitrogen becomes limiting.  The nitrogenase complex converts the nitrogen in N<sub>2</sub> into NH<sub>3</sub> (ammonia).  This enzyme functions only under anaerobic conditions that are, in part, enforced by an O<sub>2</sub> barrier surrounding the cytoplasm of the heterocyst, as shown below.</para>
