<para id="fs-id1167067271906">Millions of species, from bacteria to blueberries to baboons, currently call Earth their home, but these organisms evolved from different species. Furthermore, scientists estimate that several million more species will become extinct before they have been classified and studied. But why don’t polar bears naturally inhabit deserts or rain forests, except, perhaps, in movies? Why do humans possess traits, such as opposable thumbs, that are unique to primates but not other mammals? How did observations of finches by Charles Darwin visiting the Galapagos Islands in the 1800s provide the foundation for our modern understanding of evolution?</para>
<para id="fs-id1167066850217" class="ost-reading-discard">The <emphasis>theory of evolution</emphasis> as proposed by Darwin is the unifying theory of biology. The tenet that all life has evolved and diversified from a common ancestor is the foundation from which we approach all questions in biology. As we learned in our exploration of the structure and function of DNA, variations in individuals within a population occur through mutation, allowing more desirable traits to be passed to the next generation. Due to competition for resources and other environmental pressures, individuals possessing more favorable adaptive characteristics are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those characteristics to the next generation with increased frequency. When environments change, what was once an unfavorable trait may become a favorable one. Organisms may evolve in response to their changing environment by the accumulation of favorable traits in succeeding generations. Thus, evolution by <emphasis>natural selection</emphasis> explains both the unity and diversity of life.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167063472124"><emphasis>Convergent evolution</emphasis> occurs when similar traits with the same function evolve in multiple species exposed to similar selection pressure, such as the wings of bats and insects. In <emphasis>divergent evolution</emphasis>, two species evolve in different directions from a common point, such as the forelimbs of humans, dogs, birds, and whales. Although Darwin’s theory was revolutionary for its time because it contrasted with long-held ideas (for example, Lamarck proposed the inheritance of <emphasis>acquired characteristics</emphasis>), evidence drawn from many scientific disciplines, including the fossil record, the existence of homologous and vestigial structures, mathematics, and DNA analysis supports evolution through natural selection. It is also important to understand that evolution continues to occur; for example, bacteria that evolve resistance to antibiotics or plants that become resistant to pesticides provide evidence for continuing change.</para>

<title>The Origin of Life</title>
<para id="fs-id1166166987840">Humans have adopted many theories regarding the origin of life over the course of our time on Earth. Early civilizations believed that life was created by supernatural forces. Organisms were hand-made to be perfectly adapted to their environment and, therefore, did not change over time. Some early thinkers, such as the Greek philosopher Aristotle, believed that organisms belonged to a ladder of increasing complexity. Based on this understanding, scientists such as Carolus Linnaeus attempted to organize all living things into classification schemes that demonstrated an increasing complexity of life.</para>
<para id="fs-id1166167402734">Over time, however, scientists came to understand that life was constantly evolving on Earth. Georges Cuvier found that fossilized remains or organisms changed as he dug into deeper rock layers (strata), indicating that the organisms present in the area had changed over time. This observation led Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck to hypothesize that organisms adapted to their environment by changing over time. As organisms used different parts of their body, those parts improved, and these changes were passed down to their offspring. Ultimately, these theories were disproven by scientists, but their development contributed to the theory of evolution that was finally formulated by Charles Darwin.</para>

<title>Charles Darwin and Natural Selection</title>
<para id="fs-idp4422704">In the mid-nineteenth century, the actual mechanism for evolution was independently conceived of and described by two naturalists: Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. Importantly, each naturalist spent time exploring the natural world on expeditions to the tropics. From 1831 to 1836, Darwin traveled around the world on <emphasis effect="italics">H.M.S. Beagle</emphasis>, including stops in South America, Australia, and the southern tip of Africa. Wallace traveled to Brazil to collect insects in the Amazon rainforest from 1848 to 1852 and to the Malay Archipelago from 1854 to 1862. Darwin’s journey, like Wallace’s later journeys to the Malay Archipelago, included stops at several island chains, the last being the Galápagos Islands west of Ecuador. On these islands, Darwin observed species of organisms on different islands that were clearly similar, yet had distinct differences. For example, the ground finches inhabiting the Galápagos Islands comprised several species with a unique beak shape (<link target-id="fig-ch18_01_01"/>). The species on the islands had a graded series of beak sizes and shapes with very small differences between the most similar. He observed that these finches closely resembled another finch species on the mainland of South America. Darwin imagined that the island species might be species modified from one of the original mainland species. Upon further study, he realized that the varied beaks of each finch helped the birds acquire a specific type of food. For example, seed-eating finches had stronger, thicker beaks for breaking seeds, and insect-eating finches had spear-like beaks for stabbing their prey.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch18_01_01" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch18-s01-lo02"><media id="fs-idm49934816" alt="Illustration shows four different species of finch from the Galápagos Islands. Beak shape ranges from broad and thick to narrow and thin.">
<image mime-type="image/jpg" src="../../media/Figure_18_01_01-c16e.jpg" width="295"/>
</media>

<caption>Darwin observed that beak shape varies among finch species. He postulated that the beak of an ancestral species had adapted over time to equip the finches to acquire different food sources.</caption></figure><para id="fs-idp1148032">Wallace and Darwin both observed similar patterns in other organisms and they independently developed the same explanation for how and why such changes could take place. Darwin called this mechanism natural selection. <emphasis>Natural selection</emphasis>, also known as “survival of the fittest,” is the more prolific reproduction of individuals with favorable traits that survive environmental change because of those traits; this leads to evolutionary change.</para>
<para id="fs-idp50154320">For example, a population of giant tortoises found in the Galapagos Archipelago was observed by Darwin to have longer necks than those that lived on other islands with dry lowlands. These tortoises were “selected” because they could reach more leaves and access more food than those with short necks. In times of drought when fewer leaves would be available, those that could reach more leaves had a better chance to eat and survive than those that couldn’t reach the food source. Consequently, long-necked tortoises would be more likely to be reproductively successful and pass the long-necked trait to their offspring. Over time, only long-necked tortoises would be present in the population.</para>
<para id="fs-idp77605168">Natural selection, Darwin argued, was an inevitable outcome of three principles that operated in nature. First, most characteristics of organisms are inherited, or passed from parent to offspring. Although no one, including Darwin and Wallace, knew how this happened at the time, it was a common understanding. Second, more offspring are produced than are able to survive, so resources for survival and reproduction are limited. The capacity for reproduction in all organisms outstrips the availability of resources to support their numbers. Thus, there is competition for those resources in each generation. Both Darwin and Wallace’s understanding of this principle came from reading an essay by the economist Thomas Malthus who discussed this principle in relation to human populations. Third, offspring vary among each other in regard to their characteristics and those variations are inherited. Darwin and Wallace reasoned that offspring with inherited characteristics which allow them to best compete for limited resources will survive and have more offspring than those individuals with variations that are less able to compete. Because characteristics are inherited, these traits will be better represented in the next generation. This will lead to change in populations over generations in a process that Darwin called descent with modification. Ultimately, natural selection leads to greater adaptation of the population to its local environment; it is the only mechanism known for adaptive evolution.</para>
<para id="fs-idp812944">Papers by Darwin and Wallace (<link target-id="fig-ch18_01_02"/>) presenting the idea of natural selection were read together in 1858 before the Linnean Society in London. The following year Darwin’s book, <emphasis effect="italics">On the Origin of Species, </emphasis>was published. His book outlined in considerable detail his arguments for evolution by natural selection.</para>

<caption>Both (a) Charles Darwin and (b) Alfred Wallace wrote scientific papers on natural selection that were presented together before the Linnean Society in 1858.</caption></figure><para id="fs-idm13442992">Demonstrations of evolution by natural selection are time consuming and difficult to obtain. One of the best examples has been demonstrated in the very birds that helped to inspire Darwin’s theory: the Galápagos finches. Peter and Rosemary Grant and their colleagues have studied Galápagos finch populations every year since 1976 and have provided important demonstrations of natural selection. The Grants found changes from one generation to the next in the distribution of beak shapes with the medium ground finch on the Galápagos island of Daphne Major. The birds have inherited variation in the bill shape with some birds having wide deep bills and others having thinner bills. During a period in which rainfall was higher than normal because of an El Niño, the large hard seeds that large-billed birds ate were reduced in number; however, there was an abundance of the small soft seeds which the small-billed birds ate. Therefore, survival and reproduction were much better in the following years for the small-billed birds. In the years following this El Niño, the Grants measured beak sizes in the population and found that the average bill size was smaller. Since bill size is an inherited trait, parents with smaller bills had more offspring and the size of bills had evolved to be smaller. As conditions improved in 1987 and larger seeds became more available, the trend toward smaller average bill size ceased.</para>

<para id="fs-idp36297104">Many people hike, explore caves, scuba dive, or climb mountains for recreation. People often participate in these activities hoping to see wildlife. Experiencing the outdoors can be incredibly enjoyable and invigorating. What if your job was to be outside in the wilderness? Field biologists by definition work outdoors in the “field.” The term field in this case refers to any location outdoors, even under water. A field biologist typically focuses research on a certain species, group of organisms, or a single habitat (<link target-id="fig-ch18_01_03"/>).</para>

Not only do such findings expand our understanding of the natural world, but they also lead to important innovations in fields such as medicine and agriculture. Plant and microbial species, in particular, can reveal new medicinal and nutritive knowledge. Other organisms can play key roles in ecosystems or be considered rare and in need of protection. When discovered, these important species can be used as evidence for environmental regulations and laws.</para>

<title>Processes and Patterns of Evolution</title>
<para id="fs-idp115962288">Natural selection can only take place if there is <emphasis>variation</emphasis>, or differences, among individuals in a population. Importantly, these differences must have some genetic basis; otherwise, the selection will not lead to change in the next generation. This is critical because variation among individuals can be caused by non-genetic reasons such as an individual being taller because of better nutrition rather than different genes.</para>
<para id="fs-idp33338224">Genetic diversity in a population comes from two main mechanisms: mutation and sexual reproduction. Mutation, a change in DNA, is the ultimate source of new alleles, or new genetic variation in any population. The genetic changes caused by mutation can have one of three outcomes on the phenotype. A mutation can affect the phenotype of the organism in a way that gives it reduced fitness—lower likelihood of survival or fewer offspring. Alternatively, a mutation may produce a phenotype with a beneficial effect on fitness. And, many mutations will also have no effect on the fitness of the phenotype; these are called neutral mutations. Mutations may also have a whole range of effect sizes on the fitness of the organism that expresses them in their phenotype, from a small effect to a great effect. Sexual reproduction also leads to genetic diversity: when two parents reproduce, unique combinations of alleles assemble to produce the unique genotypes and thus phenotypes in each of the offspring.</para>
<para id="fs-idp107347984">A heritable trait that helps the survival and reproduction of an organism in its present environment is called an <emphasis>adaptation</emphasis>. Scientists describe groups of organisms becoming adapted to their environment when a change in the range of genetic variation occurs over time that increases or maintains the “fit” of the population to its environment. The webbed feet of platypuses are an adaptation for swimming. The snow leopards’ thick fur is an adaptation for living in the cold. The cheetahs’ fast speed is an adaptation for catching prey.</para>
<para id="fs-id1166166959535">These adaptations can occur through the rearrangements of entire genomes or can be caused by the mutation of a single gene. For example, dogs have 78 chromosomes while cats have 38. A large number of the characteristics that distinguish dogs from cats arose from chromosomal rearrangements that have occurred since both groups diverged from their last common ancestor. On the other hand, certain mice are white and other mice are black. The difference in fur color occurs through the mutation of a single gene. Thus, as a result of a single mutation, a mouse population can become more adapted to survive in snowy environments versus a dark, forest floor.</para>
<para id="fs-idp82108048">Whether or not a trait is favorable depends on the environmental conditions at the time. The same traits are not always selected because environmental conditions can change. For example, consider a species of plant that grew in a moist climate and did not need to conserve water. Large leaves were selected because they allowed the plant to obtain more energy from the sun. Large leaves require more water to maintain than small leaves, and the moist environment provided favorable conditions to support large leaves. After thousands of years, the climate changed, and the area no longer had excess water. The direction of natural selection shifted so that plants with small leaves were selected because those populations were able to conserve water to survive the new environmental conditions.</para>
<para id="fs-idm40399968">The evolution of species has resulted in enormous variation in form and function. Sometimes, evolution gives rise to groups of organisms that become tremendously different from each other. When two species evolve in diverse directions from a common point, it is called divergent evolution. Such divergent evolution can be seen in the forms of the reproductive organs of flowering plants which share the same basic anatomies; however, they can look very different as a result of selection in different physical environments and adaptation to different kinds of pollinators (<link target-id="fig-ch18_01_04"/>).</para>

For example, flight has evolved in both bats and insects, and they both have structures we refer to as wings, which are adaptations to flight. However, the wings of bats and insects have evolved from very different original structures. This phenomenon is called convergent evolution, where  similar traits  evolve independently in species that do not share a recent common ancestry. The two species came to the same function, flying, but did so separately from each other.</para><para id="fs-idp48928224">These physical changes occur over enormous spans of time and help explain how evolution occurs. Natural selection acts on individual organisms, which in turn can shape an entire species. Although natural selection may work in a single generation on an individual, it can take thousands or even millions of years for the genotype of an entire species to evolve. It is over these large time spans that life on earth has changed and continues to change.</para>

<title>Evidence of Evolution</title>

<para id="fs-idp177502144">Fossils provide solid evidence that organisms from the past are not the same as those found today, and fossils show the gradual evolutionary changes over time. Scientists determine the age of fossils and categorize them from all over the world to determine when the organisms lived relative to each other. The resulting fossil record tells the story of the past and shows the evolution of form over millions of years (<link target-id="fig-ch18_01_05"/>).

<para id="fs-idm18168368">Another piece of evidence of evolution is the convergence of form in organisms that share similar environments.

Mutational tweaking in the embryo can have such magnified consequences in the adult that embryo formation tends to be conserved. As a result, structures that are absent in some groups often appear in their embryonic forms and disappear by the time the adult or juvenile form is reached. For example, all vertebrate embryos, including humans, exhibit gill slits and tails at some point in their early development. These disappear in the adults of terrestrial groups but are maintained in adult forms of aquatic groups such as fish and some amphibians. Great ape embryos, including humans, have a tail structure during their development that is lost by the time of birth.</para>

<title>Biogeography</title>
<para id="fs-idm39906832">The geographic distribution of organisms on the planet follows patterns that are best explained by evolution in conjunction with the movement of tectonic plates over geological time. Broad groups that evolved before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea (about 200 million years ago) are distributed worldwide. Groups that evolved since the breakup appear uniquely in regions of the planet, such as the unique flora and fauna of northern continents that formed from the supercontinent Laurasia and of the southern continents that formed from the supercontinent Gondwana. The presence of members of the plant family Proteaceae in Australia, southern Africa, and South America, for example, is best explained by their presence prior to the southern supercontinent Gondwana breaking up.</para>
<para id="fs-idp46317792">The great diversification of marsupials in Australia and the absence of other mammals reflect Australia’s long isolation. Australia has an abundance of endemic species—species found nowhere else—which is typical of islands whose isolation by expanses of water prevents species from migrating. Over time, these species diverge evolutionarily into new species that look very different from their ancestors that may exist on the mainland. The marsupials of Australia, the finches on the Galápagos, and many species on the Hawaiian Islands are all unique to their one point of origin, yet they display distant relationships to ancestral species on mainlands.</para>

<title>Molecular Biology</title>
<para id="fs-idp38956352">Like anatomical structures, the structures of the molecules of life reflect descent with modification. Evidence of a common ancestor for all of life is reflected in the universality of DNA as the genetic material and in the near universality of the genetic code and the machinery of DNA replication and expression. Fundamental divisions in life between the three domains are reflected in major structural differences in otherwise conservative structures such as the components of ribosomes and the structures of membranes. In general, the relatedness of groups of organisms is reflected in the similarity of their DNA sequences—exactly the pattern that would be expected from descent and diversification from a common ancestor.</para>
<para id="fs-idp38453984">DNA sequences have also shed light on some of the mechanisms of evolution. For example, it is clear that the evolution of new functions for proteins commonly occurs after gene duplication events that allow the free modification of one copy by mutation, selection, or drift (changes in a population’s gene pool resulting from chance), while the second copy continues to produce a functional protein.</para>

A common example of this is the spread of antibiotic resistant genes in a population of bacteria. When bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, alleles that help the organism survive increase in frequency <link target-id="ep-01"/>. This is because individuals that cannot resist the antibacterial die off, leaving only individuals with the resistance gene to reproduce.</para>

<title>Adaptations for homeostasis</title>
<para id="fs-id1166168335005">One major reason that organisms adapt is to maintain homeostasis, one of the main characteristics of life. All organisms have likely descended from a single common ancestor, which is why so many organisms share anatomical, morphological, and molecular features. However, each organism has adapted these similar features to suit their environment and adapt to environmental changes over time. For example, all organisms use DNA polymerase to replicate their genomes. However, whereas organisms with small genomes can get away with just a single polymerase molecule working at one point in the genome at time, organisms with larger genomes replicate many points of the genome simultaneously. Other organisms that live in extremely hot environments, such as deep-sea thermal vents, have specialized polymerase molecules that can withstand the heat that would quickly denature the polymerases in land-based animals. Although the basis for each of these different DNA polymerase molecules is the same, each one has been adapted to function in the organisms environmental niche.</para>

<title>Evolution Is Just a Theory</title>
<para id="fs-idm14482288">Critics of the theory of evolution dismiss its importance by purposefully confounding the everyday usage of the word “theory” with the way scientists use the word. In science, a “theory” is understood to be a body of thoroughly tested and verified explanations for a set of observations of the natural world. Scientists have a theory of the atom, a theory of gravity, and the theory of relativity, each of which describes understood facts about the world. In the same way, the theory of evolution describes facts about the living world. As such, a theory in science has survived significant efforts to discredit it by scientists. In contrast, a “theory” in common vernacular is a word meaning a guess or suggested explanation; this meaning is more akin to the scientific concept of “hypothesis.” When critics of evolution say evolution is “just a theory,” they are implying that there is little evidence supporting it and that it is still in the process of being rigorously tested. This is a mischaracterization.</para>

<title>Individuals Evolve</title>
<para id="fs-idm60941600">Evolution is the change in genetic composition of a population over time, specifically over generations, resulting from differential reproduction of individuals with certain alleles. Individuals do change over their lifetime, obviously, but this is called development and involves changes programmed by the set of genes the individual acquired at birth in coordination with the individual’s environment. When thinking about the evolution of a characteristic, it is probably best to think about the change of the average value of the characteristic in the population over time. For example, when natural selection leads to bill-size change in medium-ground finches in the Galápagos, this does not mean that individual bills on the finches are changing. If one measures the average bill size among all individuals in the population at one time and then measures the average bill size in the population several years later, this average value will be different as a result of evolution. Although some individuals may survive from the first time to the second, they will still have the same bill size; however, there will be many new individuals that contribute to the shift in average bill size.</para>

<title>Evolution Explains the Origin of Life</title>
<para id="fs-idp57388688">It is a common misunderstanding that evolution includes an explanation of life’s origins. Some of the theory’s critics believe that it cannot explain the origin of life. The theory does not try to explain the origin of life. The theory of evolution explains how populations change over time and how life diversifies the origin of species. It does not shed light on the beginnings of life including the origins of the first cells, which is how life is defined. The mechanisms of the origin of life on Earth are a particularly difficult problem because it occurred a very long time ago, and presumably it just occurred once. Importantly, biologists believe that the presence of life on Earth precludes the possibility that the events that led to life on Earth can be repeated because the intermediate stages would immediately become food for existing living things.</para>
<para id="fs-idp95118672">However, once a mechanism of inheritance was in place in the form of a molecule like DNA either within a cell or pre-cell, these entities would be subject to the principle of natural selection. More effective reproducers would increase in frequency at the expense of inefficient reproducers. So while evolution does not explain the origin of life, it may have something to say about some of the processes operating once pre-living entities acquired certain properties.</para>
</section>
<section id="fs-idm49884976" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch18-s01-lo05">
<title>Organisms Evolve on Purpose</title>
<para id="fs-idp71002752">Statements such as “organisms evolve in response to a change in an environment” are quite common, but such statements can lead to two types of misunderstandings. First, the statement must not be understood to mean that individual organisms evolve. The statement is shorthand for “a population evolves in response to a changing environment.” However, a second misunderstanding may arise by interpreting the statement to mean that the evolution is somehow intentional. A changed environment results in some individuals in the population, those with particular phenotypes, benefiting and therefore producing proportionately more offspring than other phenotypes. This results in change in the population if the characteristics are genetically determined.</para>
<para id="fs-idm42084400">It is also important to understand that the variation that natural selection works on is already in a population and does not arise in response to an environmental change. For example, applying antibiotics to a population of bacteria will, over time, select a population of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. The resistance, which is caused by a gene, did not arise by mutation because of the application of the antibiotic. The gene for resistance was already present in the gene pool of the bacteria, likely at a low frequency. The antibiotic, which kills the bacterial cells without the resistance gene, strongly selects individuals that are resistant, since these would be the only ones that survived and divided. Experiments have demonstrated that mutations for antibiotic resistance do not arise as a result of antibiotic application.</para>
<para id="fs-idp38734752">In a larger sense, evolution is not goal directed. Species do not become “better” over time; they simply track their changing environment with adaptations that maximize their reproduction in a particular environment at a particular time. Evolution has no goal of making faster, bigger, more complex, or even smarter species, despite the commonness of this kind of language in popular discourse. What characteristics evolve in a species are a function of the variation present and the environment, both of which are constantly changing in a non-directional way. What trait is fit in one environment at one time may well be fatal at some point in the future. This holds equally well for a species of insect as it does the human species.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-idm62061344">Evolution is the process of adaptation through mutation which allows more desirable characteristics to be passed to the next generation. Over time, organisms evolve more characteristics that are beneficial to their survival. For living organisms to adapt and change to environmental pressures, genetic variation must be present. With genetic variation, individuals have differences in form and function that allow some to survive certain conditions better than others. These organisms pass their favorable traits to their offspring. Eventually, environments change, and what was once a desirable, advantageous trait may become an undesirable trait and organisms may further evolve. Evolution may be convergent with similar traits evolving in multiple species or divergent with diverse traits evolving in multiple species that came from a common ancestor. Evidence of evolution can be observed by means of DNA code and the fossil record, and also by the existence of homologous and vestigial structures.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164967750881">In 1952, the Miller-Urey experiment showed that an electrical discharge in a gas-phase mixture of ammonia, hydrogen, methane, and water produced five amino acids.  When the experiment was conducted, evidence indicated that this mixture was representative of the Hadean (early Earth) atmosphere.  The experiment was repeated in the presence of jets of hot steam, simulating Hadean volcanic eruptions and producing an even larger variety of amino acids.</para>

Elisa et al., <emphasis effect="italics">ACS Central Science</emphasis>, 2016).  The arrival from space of the seeds of biomolecules is called panspermia.  Carl Sagan (1966) and Francis Crick (1973), one of the first to describe the structure of DNA, regarded panspermia as the only plausible origin of life on Earth.

<para id="fs-id1164960733293">Directed evolution is an inquiry strategy that is usually used to investigate gene expression or the function of proteins that are expressed.  The investigator imposes a selection pressure and observes the evolution of a population.  In one investigation, unicellular yeast were allowed to sediment in a column of a nutrient-containing solution.  Individuals that traveled furthest towards the bottom of the column were removed and placed in a new column.  After 60 generations of repeated selection, yeast became multicellular.  In this experiment, selection was acting on the collection of cells and not on the individual.  To test the claim that selection was acting on the multicellular system and not just individual cells, the investigators compared the effects on a population of yeast that had acquired multicellularity by strong selection (allowing only 5 minutes to settle) and weak selection (allowing 25 minutes to settle).  A strong selection increased cluster size, and a weak selection decreased cluster size.</para>
