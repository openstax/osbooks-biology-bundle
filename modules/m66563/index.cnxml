<para id="fs-idm8171024">Although we often think of fungi as organisms that cause disease and rot food, they are vitally important to human life on many levels. As we have seen, fungi influence the well-being of human populations on a large scale because they are part of the nutrient cycle in ecosystems. They have other ecosystem roles as well. As animal pathogens, fungi help to control the population of damaging pests. These fungi are very specific to the insects they attack, and do not infect other animals or plants. Fungi are currently under investigation as potential microbial insecticides, with several already on the market. For example, the fungus <emphasis effect="italics">Beauveria bassiana</emphasis> is being tested as a possible biological control agent for the recent spread of emerald ash borer a beetle that feeds on ash trees. It has been released in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, and Maryland (<link target-id="fig-ch24_05_01"/>).</para>

<caption>Fungal insect control. The emerald ash borer (<emphasis effect="italics">Agrilus planipennis</emphasis>) is an insect that attacks ash trees. It is in turn parasitized by a pathogenic fungus (<emphasis effect="italics">Beauveria bassiana</emphasis>) that holds promise as a biological insecticide. The parasitic fungus appears as white fuzz on the body of the insect. (credit: Houping Liu, USDA Agricultural Research Service)</caption>

<para id="fs-idp123386496">The mycorrhizal relationship between fungi and plant roots is essential for the productivity of farm land. Without the fungal partner in root systems, 80–90 percent of trees and grasses would not survive. Mycorrhizal fungal inoculants are available as soil amendments from gardening supply stores and are promoted by supporters of organic agriculture, but there is little evidence as to the effectiveness.</para><para id="fs-idp84960768">We also eat some types of fungi. Mushrooms figure prominently in the human diet. Morels, shiitake mushrooms, chanterelles, and truffles are considered delicacies (<link target-id="fig-ch24_05_02"/>). The humble meadow mushroom, <emphasis effect="italics">Agaricus campestris</emphasis>, appears in many dishes. Molds of the genus <emphasis effect="italics">Penicillium</emphasis> ripen many cheeses. They originate in the natural environment such as the caves of Roquefort, France, where wheels of sheep milk cheese are stacked in order to capture the molds responsible for the blue veins and pungent taste of the cheese.</para>

Wild yeasts are acquired from the environment and used to ferment sugars into CO<sub>2</sub> and ethyl alcohol under anaerobic conditions. It is now possible to purchase isolated strains of wild yeasts from different wine-making regions. Louis Pasteur was instrumental in developing a reliable strain of brewer’s yeast, <emphasis effect="italics">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</emphasis>, for the French brewing industry in the late 1850s. This was one of the first examples of biotechnology patenting.</para>
<para id="fs-idm7879216">Many secondary metabolites of fungi are of great commercial importance. Antibiotics are naturally produced by fungi to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, limiting their competition in the natural environment. Important antibiotics, such as penicillin and the cephalosporins, are isolated from fungi. Valuable drugs isolated from fungi include the immunosuppressant drug <emphasis effect="italics">cyclosporine</emphasis> (which reduces the risk of rejection after organ transplant), the precursors of steroid hormones, and ergot alkaloids used to stop bleeding. Psilocybin is a compound found in fungi such as <emphasis effect="italics">Psilocybe semilanceata </emphasis>and <emphasis effect="italics">Gymnopilus junonius, </emphasis>which have been used for their hallucinogenic properties by various cultures for thousands of years.</para>
<para id="fs-idp56929792">As simple eukaryotic organisms, fungi are important model research organisms. Many advances in modern genetics were achieved by the use of the red bread mold <emphasis effect="italics">Neurospora crassa</emphasis>. Additionally, many important genes originally discovered in <emphasis effect="italics">S. cerevisiae</emphasis> served as a starting point in discovering analogous human genes. As a eukaryotic organism, the yeast cell produces and modifies proteins in a manner similar to human cells, as opposed to the bacterium <emphasis effect="italics">Escherichia coli,</emphasis> which lacks the internal membrane structures and enzymes to tag proteins for export. This makes yeast a much better organism for use in recombinant DNA technology experiments. Like bacteria, yeasts grow easily in culture, have a short generation time, and are amenable to genetic modification.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-idp35805392">Fungi are important to everyday human life. Fungi are important decomposers in most ecosystems. Mycorrhizal fungi are essential for the growth of most plants. Fungi, as food, play a role in human nutrition in the form of mushrooms, and also as agents of fermentation in the production of bread, cheeses, alcoholic beverages, and numerous other food preparations. Secondary metabolites of fungi are used as medicines, such as antibiotics and anticoagulants. Fungi are model organisms for the study of eukaryotic genetics and metabolism.</para>

Fungi are important decomposers in ecosystems, ensuring that dead plants and animals are broken down into smaller molecules that can be used by other members of the ecosystem. Without fungi, decaying organic matter would accumulate in the forest.
In the carbon cycle, fungi decompose organic matter into small carbon-containing compounds. This process releases carbon dioxide back into the air for plants to use during the carbon-fixation steps of photosynthesis.
</para>
<para id="eip-ds1837">
In the nitrogen cycle, decomposition by fungi also releases nitrogen for use by living organisms. In this cycle, the nitrogen is released from organic compounds in the form of ammonia.
