<para id="fs-id1167065939188">All organisms, from simple bacteria and yeast to complex plants and animals, carry out some form of cellular respiration to capture and supply free energy for cellular processes. Although cellular respiration and photosynthesis evolved as independent processes, today they are interdependent. The products of photosynthesis, carbohydrates and oxygen gas, are used during cellular respiration. Likewise, the byproduct of cellular respiration, CO<sub>2</sub> gas, is used during photosynthesis. Glycolysis is the first pathway used in the breakdown of glucose to extract free energy. Used by nearly all organisms on earth today, glycolysis likely evolved as one of the first metabolic pathways. It is important to note that glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. (Remember that only eukaryotic cells have mitochondria.)</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065800953">Like all metabolic pathways, glycolysis occurs in steps or stages. In the first stage, the six-carbon ring of glucose is prepared for cleavage (“splitting”) into two three-carbon molecules by investing two molecules of ATP to energize the separation. (Don’t worry; the cell will get the investment of ATP back. It’s like the stock market: You have to invest money to, hopefully, make money!) As glucose is metabolized further, bonds are rearranged through a series of enzyme-catalyzed steps, and free energy is released to form ATP from ADP and free phosphate molecules. The availability of enzymes can affect the rate of glucose metabolism. Two molecules of pyruvate are ultimately produced. High-energy electrons and hydrogen atoms pass to NAD<sup>+</sup>, reducing it to NADH. Although two molecules of ATP were invested to destabilize glucose at the beginning of the process, four molecules of ATP are formed by substrate-level phosphorylation, resulting in a net gain of two ATP and two NADH molecules for the cell.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167065841082">Discuss with students how glycolysis is considered to be the oldest and most conserved metabolic pathway. Discuss with students how this process is found in all domains of life. Glycolysis is an anaerobic process, and the early atmosphere of Earth had very little oxygen. This means that glycolysis could have taken place in early prokaryotes because it does not require oxygen. Glycolysis takes place in the cell cytosol, and not the mitochondrial membrane. Prokaryotes, which don’t have membrane bound organelles, can carry out glycolysis.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065885222">Introduce the process of glycolysis using visuals such as this <link window="new" url="https://openstax.org/l/32glycolysis">video</link>.</para></note>

<para id="fs-id1392597">You have read that nearly all of the energy used by living cells comes to them in the bonds of the sugar, glucose. <term id="term-00001">Glycolysis</term> is the first step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cellular metabolism. Nearly all living organisms carry out glycolysis as part of their metabolism. The process does not use oxygen and is therefore <term id="term-00002">anaerobic</term>. Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Glucose enters heterotrophic cells in two ways. One method is through secondary active transport in which the transport takes place against the glucose concentration gradient. The other mechanism uses a group of integral proteins called GLUT proteins, also known as glucose transporter proteins. These transporters assist in the facilitated diffusion of glucose.</para><para id="fs-id2054513">Glycolysis begins with the six carbon ring-shaped structure of a single glucose molecule and ends with two molecules of a three-carbon keto acid called <term id="term-00003">pyruvate</term>. Glycolysis consists of two distinct phases. The first part of the glycolysis pathway traps the glucose molecule in the cell and uses energy to modify it so that the six-carbon sugar molecule can be split evenly into the two three-carbon molecules. The second part of glycolysis extracts energy from the molecules and stores it in the form of ATP and NADH, the reduced form of NAD<sup>+</sup>.</para>

<title>First Half of Glycolysis (Energy-Requiring Steps)</title>
    <para id="fs-id2883758">Step 1. The first step in glycolysis (<link target-id="fig-ch07_02_01"/>) is catalyzed by hexokinase, an enzyme with broad specificity that catalyzes the phosphorylation of six-carbon sugars. Hexokinase phosphorylates glucose using ATP as the source of the phosphate, producing glucose-6-phosphate, a more reactive form of glucose. This reaction prevents the phosphorylated glucose molecule from continuing to interact with the GLUT proteins, and it can no longer leave the cell because the negatively charged phosphate will not allow it to cross the hydrophobic interior of the plasma membrane.</para>
<para id="fs-id1595819">Step 2. In the second step of glycolysis, an isomerase converts glucose-6-phosphate into one of its isomers, fructose-6-phosphate. An <term id="term-00004">isomerase</term> is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of a molecule into one of its isomers. (This change from phosphoglucose to phosphofructose allows the eventual split of the sugar into two three-carbon molecules.).</para>
<para id="fs-id2316327">Step 3. The third step is the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate, catalyzed by the enzyme phosphofructokinase. A second ATP molecule donates a high-energy phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, producing fructose-1,6-<emphasis effect="underline">bi</emphasis>sphosphate. In this pathway, phosphofructokinase is a rate-limiting enzyme. It is active when the concentration of ADP is high; it is less active when ADP levels are low and the concentration of ATP is high. Thus, if there is “sufficient” ATP in the system, the pathway slows down. This is a type of end product inhibition, since ATP is the end product of glucose catabolism.</para>
<para id="fs-id1720364">Step 4. The newly added high-energy phosphates further destabilize fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The fourth step in glycolysis employs an enzyme, aldolase, to cleave fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into two three-carbon isomers: dihydroxyacetone-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.</para><para id="fs-id2258484">Step 5. In the fifth step, an isomerase transforms the dihydroxyacetone-phosphate into its isomer, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Thus, the pathway will continue with two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. At this point in the pathway, there is a net investment of energy from two ATP molecules in the breakdown of one glucose molecule.</para><figure id="fig-ch07_02_01" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch07-s02-lo01 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch07-s02-aplo-2-4 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch07-s02-aplo-2-5 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch07-s02-aplo-1-15"><media id="fs-id1797657" alt="This illustration shows the steps in the first half of glycolysis. In step one, the enzyme hexokinase uses one A T P molecule in the phosphorylation of glucose. In step two, glucose dash 6 dash phosphate is rearranged to form fructose dash 6 dash phosphate by phosphoglucose isomerase. In step three, phosphofructokinase uses a second A T P molecule in the phosphorylation of the substrate, forming fructose dash 1, 6 dash bisphosphate. In step four, the enzyme fructose bisphosphate aldolase splits the substrate into two, forming glyceraldeyde dash 3 dash phosphate and dihydroxyacetone-phosphate.

<title>Second Half of Glycolysis (Energy-Releasing Steps)</title>
<para id="fs-id3053333">So far, glycolysis has cost the cell two ATP molecules and produced two small, three-carbon sugar molecules. Both of these molecules will proceed through the second half of the pathway, and sufficient energy will be extracted to pay back the two ATP molecules used as an initial investment and produce a profit for the cell of two additional ATP molecules and two even higher-energy NADH molecules.</para>
<para id="fs-id2583910">Step 6. The sixth step in glycolysis (<link target-id="fig-ch07_02_02"/>) oxidizes the sugar (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate), extracting high-energy electrons, which are picked up by the electron carrier NAD<sup>+</sup>, producing NADH. The sugar is then phosphorylated by the addition of a second phosphate group, producing 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Note that the second phosphate group does not require another ATP molecule.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch07_02_02" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch07-s02-lo01 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch07-s02-aplo-2-4 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch07-s02-aplo-2-5 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch07-s02-aplo-1-15"><media id="fs-id2862466" alt="This illustration shows the steps in the second half of glycolysis.

In step seven, the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase removes a phosphate group from the substrate, forming one ATP molecule and 3-phosphoglycerate. In step eight, the enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase rearranges the substrate to form 2-phosphoglycerate. In step nine, the enzyme enolase rearranges the substrate to form phosphoenolpyruvate. In step ten, a phosphate group is removed from the substrate, forming one ATP molecule and pyruvate.">

<caption>The second half of glycolysis involves phosphorylation without ATP investment (step 6) and produces two NADH and four ATP molecules per glucose.</caption></figure><para id="fs-id1785709">Here again is a potential limiting factor for this pathway. The continuation of the reaction depends upon the availability of the oxidized form of the electron carrier, NAD<sup>+</sup>. Thus, NADH must be continuously oxidized back into NAD<sup>+</sup> in order to keep this step going. If NAD<sup>+</sup> is not available, the second half of glycolysis slows down or stops. If oxygen is available in the system, the NADH will be oxidized readily, though indirectly, and the high-energy electrons from the hydrogen released in this process will be used to produce ATP. In an environment without oxygen, an alternate pathway (fermentation) can provide the oxidation of NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup>.</para>
<para id="fs-id3041654">Step 7. In the seventh step, catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase (an enzyme named for the reverse reaction), 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate donates a high-energy phosphate to ADP, forming one molecule of ATP. (This is an example of substrate-level phosphorylation.) A carbonyl group on the 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is oxidized to a carboxyl group, and 3-phosphoglycerate is formed.</para>
<para id="fs-id1986553">Step 8. In the eighth step, the remaining phosphate group in 3-phosphoglycerate moves from the third carbon to the second carbon, producing 2-phosphoglycerate (an isomer of 3-phosphoglycerate). The enzyme catalyzing this step is a mutase (isomerase).</para>
<para id="fs-id1451059">Step 9. Enolase catalyzes the ninth step. This enzyme causes 2-phosphoglycerate to lose water from its structure; this is a dehydration reaction, resulting in the formation of a double bond that increases the potential energy in the remaining phosphate bond and produces phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP).</para>
<para id="fs-id1998100">Step 10. The last step in glycolysis is catalyzed by the enzyme pyruvate kinase (the enzyme in this case is named for the reverse reaction of pyruvate’s conversion into PEP) and results in the production of a second ATP molecule by substrate-level phosphorylation and the compound pyruvic acid (or its salt form, pyruvate). Many enzymes in enzymatic pathways are named for the reverse reactions, since the enzyme can catalyze both forward and reverse reactions (these may have been described initially by the reverse reaction that takes place in vitro, under non-physiological conditions).</para>
