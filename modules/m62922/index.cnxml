<para id="fs-id1167065721704">The concepts presented in this module are not within the scope for AP<sup>®</sup> other than to note that the brain houses the control center for the sensation of hunger and satiety (fullness). The functions of the digestive system are regulated through neural and hormonal responses. In the chapter that discusses the endocrine system, we explore in detail the role of the endocrine system in maintaining homeostasis, including the normal functioning of the digestive system.</para></section>

<title>Neural Responses to Food</title>
<para id="fs-idp48082448">In reaction to the smell, sight, or thought of food, like that shown in <link target-id="fig-ch34_04_01" document=""/>, the first response is that of salivation. The salivary glands secrete more saliva in response to stimulation by the autonomic nervous system triggered by the food in preparation for digestion. Simultaneously, the stomach begins to produce hydrochloric acid to digest the food. Recall that the peristaltic movements of the esophagus and other organs of the digestive tract are under the control of the brain. The brain prepares these muscles for movement as well. When the stomach is full, the part of the brain that detects satiety signals fullness. There are three overlapping phases of gastric control—the cephalic phase, the gastric phase, and the intestinal phase—each requires many enzymes and is under neural control as well.</para><figure id="fig-ch34_04_01" class="ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch25-s04-lo01"><media id="fs-idp68884416" alt="Photo shows plates of food on a dinner table.">

<title>Digestive Phases</title>
<para id="fs-idp67338288">The response to food begins even before food enters the mouth. The first phase of ingestion, called the <emphasis>cephalic phase</emphasis>, is controlled by the neural response to the stimulus provided by food. All aspects—such as sight, sense, and smell—trigger the neural responses resulting in salivation and secretion of gastric juices. The gastric and salivary secretion in the cephalic phase can also take place due to the thought of food. Right now, if you think about a piece of chocolate or a crispy potato chip, the increase in salivation is a cephalic phase response to the thought. The central nervous system prepares the stomach to receive food.</para>
<para id="fs-idp71992480">The <emphasis>gastric phase</emphasis> begins once the food arrives in the stomach. It builds on the stimulation provided during the cephalic phase. Gastric acids and enzymes process the ingested materials. The gastric phase is stimulated by (1) distension of the stomach, (2) a decrease in the pH of the gastric contents, and (3) the presence of undigested material. This phase consists of local, hormonal, and neural responses. These responses stimulate secretions and powerful contractions.</para>
<para id="fs-idp151464896">The <emphasis>intestinal phase</emphasis> begins when chyme enters the small intestine triggering digestive secretions. This phase controls the rate of gastric emptying. In addition to gastric emptying, when chyme enters the small intestine, it triggers other hormonal and neural events that coordinate the activities of the intestinal tract, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder.</para>

<title>Hormonal Responses to Food</title>
<para id="fs-idp43763984">The <emphasis>endocrine</emphasis> <emphasis>system</emphasis> controls the response of the various glands in the body and the release of hormones at the appropriate times.</para>
<para id="fs-idp269884304">One of the important factors under hormonal control is the stomach acid environment. During the gastric phase, the hormone <emphasis>gastrin</emphasis> is secreted by G cells in the stomach in response to the presence of proteins. Gastrin stimulates the release of stomach acid, or hydrochloric acid (HCl) which aids in the digestion of the proteins. However, when the stomach is emptied, the acidic environment need not be maintained and a hormone called <emphasis>somatostatin</emphasis> stops the release of hydrochloric acid. This is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism.</para>
<para id="fs-idp240446848">In the duodenum, digestive secretions from the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder play an important role in digesting chyme during the intestinal phase. In order to neutralize the acidic chyme, a hormone called <emphasis>secretin</emphasis> stimulates the pancreas to produce alkaline bicarbonate solution and deliver it to the duodenum. Secretin acts in tandem with another hormone called <emphasis>cholecystokinin</emphasis> (CCK). Not only does CCK stimulate the pancreas to produce the requisite pancreatic juices, it also stimulates the gallbladder to release bile into the duodenum.</para>

<para id="fs-idp47795856">There are many cases where loss of hormonal regulation can lead to illnesses. For example, the bilirubin produced by the breakdown of red blood cells is converted to bile by the liver. When there is malfunction of this process, there is excess bilirubin in the blood and bile levels are low. As a result, the body struggles with dealing with fatty food. This is why a patient suffering from jaundice is asked to eat a diet with almost zero fat.</para></solution>
