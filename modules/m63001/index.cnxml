<para id="fs-id1167065013854">Much of the information in this section is outside the scope for AP<sup>®</sup>. Although the curriculum does not require you to have detailed knowledge about the structure and physiology of the kidneys, learning how we filter blood to eliminate wastes—while also retaining vital water and other substances—provides an opportunity to apply concepts we’ve explored previously. Lack of kidney function can have detrimental effects on our health.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167064590383" class="ost-reading-discard">In coordination with the circulatory and endocrine systems, the human excretory system serves several functions: excretion of metabolic wastes, maintenance of water-salt balance (osmoregulation), maintenance of pH balance, and production of hormones. The organs of the system are the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra. Specialized cells of the kidney called nephrons (not to be confused with neurons of the nervous system) are closely associated with capillaries. Urine formation by nephrons involves three steps: filtration, in which water, nutrients, and wastes pass from the blood into the nephron; reabsorption, in which nutrients such as glucose and most water are reabsorbed back into the blood; and secretion, in which additional wastes and H<sup>+</sup> are added to urine to maintain homeostatic pH. The processes of diffusion, osmosis, and active transport ensure that the urine excreted from the body is hypertonic, thus preventing dehydration. For example, water is reabsorbed throughout nephron tubules back into capillaries via osmosis, and in another part of the tubule (ascending loop of Henle), Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>–</sup> are actively transported into the interstitial fluid.</para>

<para id="fs-idm250556992">The <emphasis>kidneys</emphasis>, illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch41_03_01" document=""/>, are a pair of bean-shaped structures that are located just below and posterior to the liver in the peritoneal cavity. The adrenal glands sit on top of each kidney and are also called the suprarenal glands. Kidneys filter blood and purify it. All the blood in the human body is filtered many times a day by the kidneys; these organs use up almost 25 percent of the oxygen absorbed through the lungs to perform this function. Oxygen allows the kidney cells to efficiently manufacture chemical energy in the form of ATP through aerobic respiration. The filtrate coming out of the kidneys is called <emphasis>urine</emphasis>.</para>

<title>Kidney Structure</title>
<para id="fs-idp79780736">Externally, the kidneys  are surrounded by three layers, illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch41_03_02" document=""/>. The outermost layer is a tough connective tissue layer called the <emphasis>renal fascia</emphasis>. The second layer is called the <emphasis>perirenal fat capsule</emphasis>, which helps anchor the kidneys in place. The third and innermost layer is the <emphasis>renal capsule</emphasis>. Internally, the kidney has three regions—an outer <emphasis>cortex</emphasis>, a <emphasis>medulla</emphasis> in the middle, and the <emphasis>renal pelvis</emphasis> in the region called the <emphasis>hilum</emphasis> of the kidney. The hilum is the concave part of the bean-shape where blood vessels and nerves enter and exit the kidney; it is also the point of exit for the ureters. The renal cortex is granular due to the presence of <emphasis>nephrons</emphasis>—the functional unit of the kidney. The medulla consists of multiple pyramidal tissue masses, called the <emphasis>renal pyramids</emphasis>. In between the pyramids are spaces called <emphasis>renal columns</emphasis> through which the blood vessels pass. The tips of the pyramids, called renal papillae, point toward the renal pelvis. There are, on average, eight renal pyramids in each kidney. The renal pyramids along with the adjoining cortical region are called the <emphasis>lobes of the kidney</emphasis>. The renal pelvis leads to the <emphasis>ureter</emphasis> on the outside of the kidney. On the inside of the kidney, the renal pelvis branches out into two or three extensions called the major <emphasis>calyces</emphasis>, which further branch into the minor calyces.

<title>Kidney Function and Physiology</title>
<para id="fs-idm58891360">Kidneys filter blood in a three-step process. First, the nephrons filter blood that runs through the capillary network in the glomerulus. Almost all solutes, except for proteins, are filtered out into the glomerulus by a process called <emphasis>glomerular filtration</emphasis>. Second, the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules. Most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the PCT by a process called <emphasis>tubular reabsorption</emphasis>. In the loop of Henle, the filtrate continues to exchange solutes and water with the renal medulla and the peritubular capillary network. Water is also reabsorbed during this step.  Then, additional solutes and wastes are secreted into the kidney tubules during <emphasis>tubular secretion</emphasis>, which is, in essence, the opposite process to tubular reabsorption. The collecting ducts collect filtrate coming from the nephrons and fuse in the medullary papillae. From here, the papillae deliver the filtrate, now called urine, into the minor calyces that eventually connect to the ureters through the renal pelvis. This entire process is illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch41_03_04" document=""/>.</para>

The nephron begins at the glomerulus, a spherical structure that filters small solutes from the blood. The filtrate then enters a winding proximal convoluted tubule, which reabsorbs ions, water, and nutrients, and removes toxins and adjusts the filtrate pH. The proximal convoluted tubule empties into the descending loop of Henle. Aquaporins in the descending loop allow water to pass from the filtrate to the interstitial fluid. The descending loop of Henle turns into the ascending loop of Henle. Both the descending loop and ascending loop are thin at the bottom, and turn thick about a third of the way up. In the ascending loop of Henle, sodium and chlorine ions are reabsorbed from the filtrate into the interstitial fluid. The ascending loop of Henle empties into the distal convoluted tubule, which selectively secretes and absorbs ions to maintain blood pH and electrolyte balance. The distal convoluted tubule empties into a collecting duct, which reabsorbs water and solutes from the filtrate. The collecting duct travels down, toward the middle of the kidney.">

<caption>Each part of the nephron performs a different function in filtering waste and maintaining homeostatic balance. (1) The glomerulus forces small solutes out of the blood by pressure. (2) The proximal convoluted tubule reabsorbs ions, water, and nutrients from the filtrate into the interstitial fluid, and actively transports toxins and drugs from the interstitial fluid into the filtrate. The proximal convoluted tubule also adjusts blood pH by selectively secreting ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) into the filtrate, where it reacts with H<sup>+</sup> to form NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. The more acidic the filtrate, the more ammonia is secreted. (3) The descending loop of Henle is lined with cells containing aquaporins that allow water to pass from the filtrate into the interstitial fluid. (4) In the thin part of the ascending loop of Henle, Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>–</sup> ions diffuse into the interstitial fluid. In the thick part, these same ions are actively transported into the interstitial fluid. Because salt but not water is lost, the filtrate becomes more dilute as it travels up the limb. (5) In the distal convoluted tubule, K<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> ions are selectively secreted into the filtrate, while Na<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>–</sup>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>– </sup>ions are reabsorbed to maintain pH and electrolyte balance in the blood. (6) The collecting duct reabsorbs solutes and water from the filtrate, forming dilute urine. (credit: modification of work by NIDDK)</caption></figure><section id="fs-idm248852816">
<title>Glomerular Filtration</title>
<para id="fs-idm88899104">Glomerular filtration filters out most of the solutes due to high blood pressure and specialized membranes in the afferent arteriole. The blood pressure in the glomerulus is maintained independent of factors that affect systemic blood pressure. The “leaky” connections between the endothelial cells of the glomerular capillary network allow solutes to pass through easily. All solutes in the glomerular capillaries, except for macromolecules like proteins, pass through by passive diffusion. There is no energy requirement at this stage of the filtration process. <emphasis>Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)</emphasis> is the volume of glomerular filtrate formed per minute by the kidneys.

Almost all nutrients are reabsorbed, and this occurs either by passive or active transport. Reabsorption of water and some key electrolytes are regulated and can be influenced by hormones. Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) is the most abundant ion and most of it is reabsorbed by active transport and then transported to the peritubular capillaries. Because Na<sup>+</sup> is actively transported out of the tubule, water follows it to even out the osmotic pressure.

The descending limb is permeable to water, not solutes; the opposite is true for the ascending limb. Additionally, the loop of Henle invades the renal medulla, which is naturally high in salt concentration and tends to absorb water from the renal tubule and concentrate the filtrate. The osmotic gradient increases as it moves deeper into the medulla.

The descending limb is water-permeable, and water travels from the limb to the interstitial space. As a consequence, the osmolality of the filtrate inside the limb increases from 300 milliosmoles per liter at the top to 1200 milliosmoles per liter at the bottom. The ascending limb is permeable to sodium and chloride ions. Because the osmolality inside bottom part of the limb is higher than the interstitial fluid, these ions diffuse out of the ascending limb. Higher up, sodium is actively transported out of the limb, and chloride follows.">

<caption>The loop of Henle acts as a countercurrent multiplier that uses energy to create concentration gradients. The descending limb is water permeable. Water flows from the filtrate to the interstitial fluid, so osmolality inside the limb increases as it descends into the renal medulla. At the bottom, the osmolality is higher inside the loop than in the interstitial fluid. Thus, as filtrate enters the ascending limb, Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>–</sup> ions exit through ion channels present in the cell membrane. Further up, Na<sup>+</sup> is actively transported out of the filtrate and Cl<sup>–</sup> follows. Osmolarity is given in units of milliosmoles per liter (mOsm/L).</caption></figure>

</note><para id="fs-idm65625088">By the time the filtrate reaches the DCT, most of the urine and solutes have been reabsorbed. If the body requires additional water, all of it can be reabsorbed at this point. Further reabsorption is controlled by hormones, which will be discussed in a later section. Excretion of wastes occurs due to lack of reabsorption combined with tubular secretion. Undesirable products like metabolic wastes, urea, uric acid, and certain drugs, are excreted by tubular secretion. Most of the tubular secretion happens in the DCT, but some occurs in the early part of the collecting duct. Kidneys also maintain an acid-base balance by secreting excess H<sup>+</sup> ions.</para>
<para id="fs-idm189006512">Although parts of the renal tubules are named proximal and distal, in a cross-section of the kidney, the tubules are placed close together and in contact with each other and the glomerulus. This allows for exchange of chemical messengers between the different cell types. For example, the DCT ascending limb of the loop of Henle has masses of cells called <emphasis>macula densa</emphasis>, which are in contact with cells of the afferent arterioles called <emphasis>juxtaglomerular cells</emphasis>. Together, the macula densa and juxtaglomerular cells form the juxtaglomerular complex (JGC). The JGC is an endocrine structure that secretes the enzyme renin and the hormone erythropoietin. When hormones trigger the macula densa cells in the DCT due to variations in blood volume, blood pressure, or electrolyte balance, these cells can immediately communicate the problem to the capillaries in the afferent and efferent arterioles, which can constrict or relax to change the glomerular filtration rate of the kidneys.</para>

<title>Section Summary</title><para id="fs-idm292625536">The kidneys are the main osmoregulatory organs in mammalian systems; they function to filter blood and maintain the osmolarity of body fluids at 300 mOsm. They are surrounded by three layers and are made up internally of three distinct regions—the cortex, medulla, and pelvis.</para>
<para id="fs-idm33870112">The blood vessels that transport blood into and out of the kidneys arise from and merge with the aorta and inferior vena cava, respectively. The renal arteries branch out from the aorta and enter the kidney where they further divide into segmental, interlobar, arcuate, and cortical radiate arteries.</para>
<para id="fs-idm104668096">The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, which actively filters blood and generates urine. The nephron is made up of the renal corpuscle and renal tubule. Cortical nephrons are found in the renal cortex, while juxtamedullary nephrons are found in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla. The nephron filters and exchanges water and solutes with two sets of blood vessels and the tissue fluid in the kidneys.</para>
